We are sad to report that Mr Money, formerly Estates Manager at Leeds
Castle in the days of Lady Baillie, and who had lived at Battel Hall in
Leeds village for over 50 years passed away in early July 2007.
&nbsp;His like will never be seen again; both with regard to his
splendid diction, and his service to the Community of Leeds in the old
days. &nbsp;He was a staunch supporter of the Landed Gentry, and of the
Book of Common Prayer, attending the 8am Communion service at Leeds
until it was done away with several years ago. &nbsp;ASELY members rang
the following Quarter peal on one of the rings of bells upon which the
Leeds Youths rang a peal of 5184 Oxford TB Major &nbsp;on Whit Monday
May 31st 1762 (tho' all the bells at New Romney have since been recast):<br>

&nbsp;Ten members of the ASELY attempted to ring a Quarter Peal of
Stedman Quators at Leeds to Mr Money's memory on 16th August 2007, but
sadly this was lost in the 8th course. &nbsp; The band stood as
follows: Treble: B.D. Kipling Esq. &nbsp;2: M.J. Jones Esq. &nbsp;3:
S.J.O. Head Esq. &nbsp;4: R.J. Chandler Esq. &nbsp;5: R.K. Bickerton
Esq. &nbsp;6: J.B. Saunders Esq. 7: M. Chittenden-Pile Esq. 8: J. Smith

      <h2>Peal Rung as a farewell to Revd. David Brookes, and to mark 70 years as Verger of Leeds Church for S.J. Russell Esq.</h2>

The peal was also rung to mark the Golden Wedding of Canon &amp; Mrs J.W. Everett [formerly Vicar of Ashford]<br>

The peal was credited to the London County Association, as Mrs Pearson
yet again stood in at the 'eleventh hour', and the Society is once more
heartily grateful to her for so doing.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>

      
      
      
      <h2>Bicentenary of the Casting of Borden Bells</h2>



      
      
      
      <p>Saturday 2nd February 2002 marked the 200th Anniversary of the casting
      of the bells of SS Peter &amp; Paul Borden, by Thomas Mears the
      Elder.&nbsp; A centenary peal of 5040 Stedman Triples was rung on Sunday
      2nd February 1902 by a local band, excepting the conductor, that lovely
      old fellow Challis F. Winney Esq, of St John, Wilton Road; St Clement
      Danes, Strand; and St Pauls Cathedral.&nbsp; The Leeds Youths had intended
      to mark this occasion with a peal of Bob Major; however due to illness of
      two members of the band this had to be reduced to Minor; not all the performers were Society members, and could not on
      any wise be rung for the ASELY as only peals of Major and above are
      allowed by the Society rules.&nbsp; Six good and true extents were rung
      beginning at 3:35 pm and failing at 6:30pm - sadly in the final extent
      there was a shift in course: five bells were out of course causing it to
      run round in the middle of the seventh extent.&nbsp; The work which the
      Leeds Youths had carried out on the bells has improved the 'go' of them
      quite significantly, and the performance is appended below: Viz</p>

      <i>4320 Plain Bob Minor (Six extents all call'd the same) in 2 hours &amp;
      50 minutes<br>

      <p>To mark the Bicentenary of the casting of the bells, and the centenary
      of a peal by a local company (excepting Mr C.F. Winney, the
      conductor).&nbsp; Believed to be the longest length of Minor rung on the
      back 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

      The Peal attempt on November 2nd 2001 was of Bob Major (Annable), due to the
      indisposition of one of the band.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after nearly 3 hours good
      ringing it came to grief due to a shift in course, which is not
      allowed.&nbsp; The peal would have been rung for the London County
      Association (Late St James' Society; 1824) had it been successful, as Mrs
      G. Pearson stood in at the last minute.&nbsp; The ASELY are extremely
      grateful to Mrs Pearson for joining them in the attempt, and would also
      like to thank many Parishioners for their warm words, and their
      interest.&nbsp; For the record, the band stood in the order:</p>



      
      
      
      <p>Friday 2nd November 2001 at Home (St Nicholas, Leeds)<br>



      <i>Upwards of 4500 changes of Bob Major in 2 hours &amp; 55 minutes<br>



      </i>Treble; I.A. Renyard Esq.<br>

      The 250th Anniversary Dinner was a great success, held in the Gate
      Tower of Leeds Castle on Saturday 15th December; 3 days after the
      anniversary of the first peal by the Leeds Youths of 6480 Bob Quators rung
      in 1751. <br>
