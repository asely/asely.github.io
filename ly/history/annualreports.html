<h1>Annual Report of the Ancient Society of Esquire Leeds
Youths</h1>
<h1><font size="3">2000/1</font></h1>

<p class="western">The year past has been a very full and exciting
year for members of the Company.  Within the Parish the bells have
been rung every Sunday morning over the past year, excepting two or
three regular Sundays when weather or other problems overcame us, and
at Christmas when members of the Company were unable to leave their
local Parishes due to family commitments.  Usually the ringing has
been on the back five bells, and the method Grandsire Doubles. 
Members of the Company are now reasonably proficient at striking this
now!  When possible, we also have a quick ring on the front six bells
as well.  
</p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3">I should like to record my thanks to
Messrs Chittenden-Pile and Moore, who share the driving to Leeds
(alternate weeks), and Messrs I &amp; P Renyard who attend Sunday
ringing each week without fail.  It is to be hoped that as time
progresses we will be able to entice other members of the Company to
ring at Leeds on Sunday on a regular basis, but unfortunately most of
the other members of the Company have commitments in their own
parishes, which clash with the ringing times at Leeds.</font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3">I have not been able to attend Sunday
services as much as I would have liked over the last few months
because of the fact that we have to go to Kennington following the
Leeds ringing and provide ringing after their service.  I also ring
at Mersham and Ashford before coming to Leeds, so this makes for
quite a busy Sunday.  I will continue to attend services in the
parish whenever possible in the future, and apologise that I cannot
attend more often.  It is to be hoped that this is a situation which
will resolve itself in the future.  I will of course still keep up to
date with the events in the Parish, and members of the Company always
like to be available for events in the Parish Calendar such as the
Harvest Supper, wine &amp; wisdom etc.</font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3">With regard to other ringing at Leeds
this year, there have been a few visiting &lsquo;outing&rsquo; bands, and two
or three peals.  The Leeds Youths have not performed anything of note
on the bells this year past, preferring to concentrate on Sunday
Service ringing, and training ringers in other Parishes.  As we do
not have any probationers in the band at Leeds, we have held only a
few practices (generally once monthly on the Second Saturday as
London County Association practices) though these have now ceased. 
During the coming year it is likely that practices will remain
occasional at Leeds, unless anyone comes forward wishing to learn the
art.  The situation is that the Sunday Service ringers ring regularly
together at other practices during the week, and so a regular
practice is unnecessary at Leeds.  Occasional more advanced practices
on the ten bells are likely to be held from now on.</font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3"><font size="3">As far as other
activities of the Company are concerned, the Leeds Youths are linked
to The Eastern Trinity Youths of London, who provide occasional
ringing at St Dunstan, Stepney; St Paul, Shadwell; St Matthew with St
James, Bethnal Green and St John, Deptford.  The other connected
Society is The Romney Marsh and District Guild of ringers who support
the ringing and train ringers at Woodchurch, Mersham, Hothfield and
Appledore.  The Leeds Youths look after the steeple keeping at Leeds,
Mersham, Borden, Woodchurch, Hothfield and Bethnal Green, and
together with the Eastern Trinity Youths have been restoring the 180
year old installation of 8 bells at St Paul, Shadwell.  Five of the
Shadwell bells were rung on January 1<sup>st</sup> 2001 when members
of the company also rang at Sevington, Leeds, Broomfield, and Bethnal
Green.  </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3">The project at Shadwell is an item of
interest in itself, for these bells have not been rung since the mid
1970&rsquo;s, when a very basic patch-up allowed the bells to be rung on
special occasions only.  This time, the work has concentrated on
retaining as much of the old installation as possible, but replacing
worn out parts with exact copies (as far as possible)  At the time of
writing this report, we are having two new bell wheels made for
Shadwell bells, and painting all the metalwork in the tower to
preserve it.  The bells of Shadwell will hopefully peal out again in
the next couple of months, and a grand evensong is to be arranged at
Shadwell Church to reopen the bells.  All the parishioners of Leeds
are invited to attend this service (details to follow)</font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3">At Leeds, the bearings have been
regularly greased with a mixture of castor oil and lard, which has
kept the bells working smoothly.  Clappers and rollers have also been
greased when required, and all bolts checked regularly and kept
tight.  There is some movement in the frame when the bells are rung,
which is to be expected in a frame of such age, which has very little
strengthening.  At Mersham 25 bags of birds nests have been removed
from the tower recently, and three of the clappers which had worked
loose were tightened, thus improving the &lsquo;go&rsquo; of those bells.</font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3">Because of the amount of work which
the Company has been doing in Kent and London over the last year, and
what has been described as a &lsquo;Victorian moral code&rsquo;, it is none
too surprising that we should have stirred some controversy in
ringing terms.  Some mischievous members of The Kent County
Association of Change Ringers have been involved in subversive
activities in an attempt to rubbish the work which we have done.  It
has become obvious that they feel threatened by the activities of our
Societies.  It is difficult to understand why they should feel this
away, as The Leeds Youths rules are very different from those of the
Kent County Association.  It is probable however that members of that
Association feel that we should be doing the work in the name of
their Association, rather than that of the Leeds Youths.  We as a
Society have already tried to assist the Kent County Association in
years past, and have simply suffered for our efforts.  The Leeds
Youths does embrace the ideals of a past era, where the ten
commandments were rigorously followed, and where etiquette was the
keyword of Society.  We make no apology for the fact that the Leeds
Youths is a male-only Society, because this is just continuing the
tradition of the original Leeds Youths, when there were no lady
ringers.  Ladies are always welcome to ring with the LeedsYouths &ndash;
there is no restriction, the only restriction is that Ladies may not
join the Leeds Youths, which is the choice of members of our Society.</font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3"><font size="3">Finally, the year 2001
is the 250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the installation of Leeds
Bells, the first peal on the Bells and the founding of the Leeds
Youths.  There will be a peal - to celebrate the 250<sup>th</sup>
Anniversary of the first peal on the bells - by members of the modern
day Leeds Youths towards the end of 2001, and the 250<sup>th</sup>
Anniversary Dinner on the same day as the Nine Lessons and Carol
Service in December.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>

<p class="western"><font size="3">I hope the activities of our
Companies are agreeable to members of the Parish, and thank you for
the support that you have given us over the past year.</font><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font size="3"><font size="3">I will notify everyone
of the 250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary celebrations later in the year</font></font></p><p class="western"></p><h1>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</h1><h1><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><b>Annual
Report of THE ANCIENT SOCIETY OF ESQUIRE LEEDS YOUTHS [Est. 1751]</b></font></h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">2001/2</span>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">The
year 2001 will go down in the annals of history as a very important
landmark in the life of The Ancient Society of Esquire Leeds Youths. 
On 2<sup>nd</sup> November 2001, 9 members of the Society met at the
Tower.  There should have been 10 members present; however one person
had misunderstood the arrangements regarding the start time.  Thus,
one person offered to stand down, and the peal to be attempted was
performed on 8 bells, rather than ten, using the same composition. 
Sadly after 3 hours very good ringing and with less than 5 minutes to
go, a couple of ringers went into confusion, and two bells shifted
course (that is, swapped over) so that the attempt did not conclude
successfully.  Five of the ringers in that attempt were full members
of the Society (that is regular Sunday service ringers), whereas the
others hailed from Appledore and York.  Another band of ringers drawn
from the Kent County Association were successful with their attempt
of the original composition on all ten bells the night before.  Thus,
well over 10,000 different changes were rung on the heaviest 8 bells
(and 6480 on the lightest two) in the space of two days.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Though
the Leeds Youths were disappointed at the lack of success with the
November peal, the 250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Dinner held at The
Gate Tower, Leeds Castle on Saturday 15<sup>th</sup> December was
much more successful.  Many were unable to come due to the time of
year, but those who did attend were entreated to a sumptuous feast in
the nobility of the Castle surroundings.  Handbells were rung at
James Barham&rsquo;s gravestone (He was the first Master of the Leeds
Youths), and the tower bells were also rung on the occasion.  After a
service at the Church, the Master, Secretary and Superintending
Beadle processed to Leeds Castle for the Dinner - the other guests
did the sensible thing and went by car -where the loyal toast to the
memory of James Barham was drunk, and the National Anthem was sung.
Special mention must be made of Mr &amp; Mrs Hardy, who supported us
so well at the Dinner, and particularly to Mrs Hardy who played at
the Church Service and the Service of Thanksgiving at The Castle,
following Dinner.  It is always a pleasure to receive support from
other members of the Church.  The Evening concluded with tune and
change ringing on handbells.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">The
above were the most important events in the Society&rsquo;s 2001
calendar, but members also rang prior to the Harvest Supper as has
become traditional.  The opportunity was taken to use this as
practice for the peal attempt on November 2<sup>nd</sup> (mentioned
above).  There were two successful Quarter Peal attempts in 2001,
both by visiting bands, though I was enlisted to the second one,
which was therefore rung to mark over 68 years as Verger for Mr S.
Russell.  An attempt for a Quarter Peal on 9<sup>th</sup> February
2002 to mark the then forthcoming 87th birthday of Mr S. Russell was
unfortunately unsuccessful, though the full time was rung for.  The
bells were also half-muffled as a token of respect to the Princess
Margaret who passed away the previous day.  Subsequently two Quarter
Peals were rung at Stepney; London, and Rolvenden; Kent, to mark Mr
Russell&rsquo;s birthday, and also the 89<sup>th</sup> birthday of Mr T.
Cullingworth of Maidstone, who has taken part in much ringing at
Leeds over the years.  A peal of Superlative (No 2) Surprise Royal on
all ten bells was achieved on Saturday 2<sup>nd</sup> February by a
visiting group of ringers.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">As far
as the general Sunday Ringing is concerned (which is of course the
proper reason for ringing bells), they have been rung for almost all
Sunday Services in the last year.  There were about three exceptions
to this, where bad weather overcame us, and Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day where all the regular ringers are engaged in their home
parishes.  We have generally managed to ring the light six and heavy
five bells on Sunday, though sometimes we manage the heavy seven or
eight, and twice managed all ten.  On one of these occasions, a
visiting group of ringers from Derbyshire swelled our numbers to 15,
and a very fine &lsquo;touch&rsquo; of Stedman Quators was rung before the
service.  </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">As
always, I should like to record my thanks to Messrs Moore, and
Chittenden-Pile for the driving on alternate weeks, and Messrs I &amp;
P Renyard who attend each week, almost without fail.  We also ring at
Ashford prior to Leeds, and afterwards at Hothfield on 1<sup>st</sup>
and 3<sup>rd</sup> Sundays (which is why I don&rsquo;t attend service at
Leeds on these Sundays).</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">As
usual, many thanks to all who support the Society in its doings, to
the inimitable style of friendliness which is forthcoming from the
Parishioners, and in thehope that we will continue to achieve our
objectives of Service to the Church and the Crown, particularly in
this, our Gracious Sovereign&rsquo;s Golden Jubilee Year.  So we continue
into the 251<sup>st</sup> Anniversary year of the Society purposing
to maintain standards and traditions.  With Thanks,</font></p>
