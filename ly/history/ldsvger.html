      <p>Leeds Church is very fortunate that it can still boast a Verger.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Mr Sid Russell has been Verger at Leeds Church since May 17<sup>th</sup>
      1933.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr Russell has served the Parish in this duty exceedingly
      faithfully, and is quite simply an absolute legend!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Leeds Youths celebrated his 70 years as verger in 2003 in fine style,
with a Barbeque on Saturday 17th May, and the Vicar arranged wine post-service on the Sunday morning.</p>

      <p>We were honoured when Mr Russell agreed to be interviewed and thus gave
      us an insight to the workings of Leeds Church when he began his office as Verger in 1933.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was
      appointed, his salary was &pound;10 a week and 30/- for each grave dug! (the job
      in those days also comprised Sexton).<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>He originally only took the job on &ldquo;for a couple of weeks&rdquo;!<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>There were three services every Sunday:<br>








      Holy Communion at 8am (Bells not rung for the early service) An average of
      20 present at the service.<img src="images/sid02.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="216" width="288"><br>








      Mattins at 11am (10 Bells rung from 10am to 11am) An average of 50 present
      at the service.<br>








      Evensong at 6:30 pm (10 Bells rung from 6pm to 6:30pm) An average of 30
      present at the service.<br>








      At Festivals (i.e. Easter, Christmas, Harvest etc) all the seats in the
      Church would be filled at the main Service, and there would be people
      standing in the aisles, and out of the door!</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Mr Russell was taught to ring the bells by his Father, and became a
      steady call-change ringer and sometime tower captain.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>He also taught a number of his family and others to ring so that
      there were enough to ring 10 bells every Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>If there were not enough ringers to man all 10 bells, then Mr
      Russell would chime the bells on the old Ellacombe (which the Society is
      planning to re-instate) in a random <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><img src="images/sid03.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="216" width="288"></span> way, or occasionally Mr George
      Lavender , the organist would chime Hymns on them (usually for Evensong).<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Mr Russell provided transport for Mr Lavender who lived in
      Harrietsham.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choirmaster
      was a Mr Butler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ringing
      practices took place on Fridays at 7pm.</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Old
      Custom:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as the death
      of a parishioner was confirmed, Mr Russell would go to the Church and toll
      bell number 7 the number of times which corresponded with the persons age.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Stahlschmidt's<span style="">&nbsp; </span>book of
      Kent bells from 1886 gives a more detailed account of the local custom
      with regard to tolling for deaths etc, but presumably post 1930 this had
      become very much simpler, and of course died out entirely at some point
      (though the Society will attempt to re-instate it in some form in the
      future, subsequent to the re-installation of the Ellacombe mechanism)</span>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In 2005 a ploy by
the hierarchy at Leeds&nbsp;to have Mr Russell removed as
Verger from the Parish Magazine, and to claim that he was no longer
Verger was wrongheadedly effected, though many of us are simply
ignoring such a preposterous step. &nbsp;He has been Verger for longer
than any of his detractors
have been alive! &nbsp;This attitude is to be depracated in the
strongest possible terms. &nbsp;Mr Russell will be Verger for as long
as he lives, regardless of the assertions of the ignorant and
disrespectful. &nbsp;The fact that he has supposedly been removed from
his post&nbsp; because he no longer carries out the duties of Verger is
foolish. &nbsp;Given the right encouragement and support he could still
attend church, at least on occasions. &nbsp;He would do so if the
Church still did the 8am Communion, 11am Matins &amp; 6:30pm Evensong.</span>
&nbsp;</p>


      
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In
February 2008, Mr Russell celebrated his 93rd birthday. &nbsp;He is now
the same age as James Barham finally attained before his death in 1818.
&nbsp;We are of course all hoping that Mr Russell will surpass this
age, and indeed&nbsp;that he will attain his centenary. &nbsp;A Quarter
Peal was attempted of Cambridge Suprise Minor on the back 6 at Leeds,
and the striking was immaculate; sadly one of the band shifted course
at the end of the penultimate course, and could not be righted, thus
the Quarter Peal failed to 'run home true'.</span></p>




      
      
      
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center">Of course, we are all looking forward to marking &nbsp;Mr
Russell's 75 years as Verger, and 75 years a member of the Royal
British Legion in May 2008.</p>
