<p class="western" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Celebration
of the 249<sup>th</sup> Anniversary</font></font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Members
of the Ancient Society of Esquire Leeds Youths and ringing friends
from many parts of the country gathered in Kent in large numbers on
Sunday 17<sup>th</sup> December 2000 for the 249<sup>th</sup>
anniversary dinner of the society.</font></font></font></font></p>


























<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">Ringing
took place at the usual churches at which the society is engaged in
training and providing ringing; at Mersham, Ashford and Leeds during
the morning.  The members present attended the Parish Holy Communion
service at Leeds, and a very good address was given by the Vicar, who
officiated.</font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">THE DINNER</h1>
<p class="western">Afterwards, a goodly company dined together in
&lsquo;the room&rsquo; at the Ten Bells Inn, and those present who had dined
at the previous year&rsquo;s dinner were heard to remark that the
gathering had increased by a goodly percentage this year.  
</p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	The
chair was taken by the Master, who reminisced of the memorable
moments and accomplishments in the year past.  He reminded those
assembled that it was less than two years since the Society had been
re-established, and since that time the members had contributed
greatly to the strength of the Society.  It was, he said, generally
recognised in the Parishes which the Society serves, that they were a
well organised bunch of men, who did their best to produce the best
striking, while at the same time welcoming beginners to the exercise,
and &lsquo;pointing the way&rsquo;, so to speak.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	The
Master also touched on some of the activities of it&rsquo;s affiliated
companies &ndash; The Antient Society of Eastern Youths of London, who
have had a very busy year in the continued restoration of that
celebrated peal of bells at St Paul, Shadwell.  The Master said that,
although he had been at the forefront of the &lsquo;physical work&rsquo; in
the tower (which was buried in 180 years worth of pollution!) he also
wished to thank Messrs Renyard for their occasional help, and Mr
Moore&rsquo;s father and Mr Gower for their services in welding some
corroded ironwork.  The Leeds Youths were looking forward to this
fine old peal of eight ringing out again, early in 2001. 
Furthermore, it was generally agreed by the company that they would
be a great challenge to ring, as an authentic installation from 1820,
with all their original fittings retained.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	The
Romney Marsh and District Guild had a rather quieter year during
2000, partly due to the general inactivity and apathy in the area. 
However, progress had been made at Woodchurch, with a regular
practice night being re-instated and a couple of young lads in
training there.  The members of the Guild were also very pleased that
a number of ladies had become members, and it was quite lovely to
have a number of talented young ladies attempting quarter peals, and
attending practices with the Guild.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	The
Master also reminded members, as a final point, that midnight ringing
to welcome the New Year would take place at Ashford, it being the 
largest audience, and stressed the importance of a &lsquo;good show.&rsquo;</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	After
the repast, the loyal toast to the Grand Master (James Barham; Master
1751 &ndash; 1819) was drunk, and the National Anthem sung.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">PREPARATIONS
FOR THE 250<sup>th</sup> ANNIVERSARY</font></font></font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="center"><br>
</p>
<p class="western">The Master proposed the toast of &lsquo;The Church&rsquo;
and remarked succinctly, &lsquo;No Church, no Ancient Society.&rsquo;  The
coming year would be a busy one, with two peals planned at Leeds
towards the end of the year on the same dates as those rung 250 years
ago.  It was indeed a grand thing that the bells at Leeds were little
altered since the installation of the front six by Mr Catlin of
Holborn and the construction of a purpose-built wooden ten bell frame
in 1751.  One can stand in the belfry and admire that sonorous peal
on their lovely old plain bearings by that master of bellhanging, Mr
Bowell of Ipswich.  Except for the recasting of seven and nine by Mr
Bowell in 1911 and  the rehanging and quarter turning of the bells at
the same time, they are untouched.</p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	Apart
from peal ringing, another thing which would be exercising the minds
of the officers during the coming year would be the fit ways and
means of celebrating a great event in the life of that Ancient
Society.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">	In
coupling with the toast the name of Mr D. Paul Smith, the Master said
he would be much in the minds of the members of the Leeds Youths this
year, and his guidance would be sought as to the best ways of
celebrating the 250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary year.  Mr Smith &ndash; who
was present at the dinner &ndash; had done another great Society proud
during his year as Master of that Company, and though he will never
ring again, he was highly valued by many Leeds Youths for his great
suggestions and support for them in their social activities.  He
thanked Mr Smith for his attendance at the dinner, for his help
throughout the year, and particularly for providing transport during
the day.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	The
Master closed the post-prandial proceedings by charging his glass and
taking wine with the members present.  He again stated how pleased he
was that such a good relationship was maintained with the incumbents
at the various towers at which the Leeds Youths were engaged, and
ended with the toast &ldquo;Let us now praise famous men, and our Fathers
which begat them.&rdquo;</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<h1 class="western">A SPLENDID END</h1>
<p class="western"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">The
formal proceedings concluded, the majority of members returned to
Ashford for a short period of lively banter in The Farriers Arms,
Mersham, while the Master and Mr Smith attended the service of seven
lessons and carols at Broomfield.  The ring of three bells were put
into action; the Master taking 2 &amp; 3, and the verger Mr Hadlow
chiming the Treble.  The service was very well organised by the
villagers, and the Church looked truly traditional.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">	When
the company met up in the Farriers arms again at just after five
o&rsquo;clock, there was an air of satisfaction with the proceedings thus
far completed.  The final challenge was to perform a touch of 1440
Kent T.B. Minor prior to the Parish nine lessons and carol service at
Mersham.  The rest of the local band had very kindly stepped aside to
allow the company to perform, and the company record herewith their
gratitude.  For the record, five Leeds Youths and one friend of the
company took part, and the method was changed to Bob Minor conducted
by Mr Chittenden Pile.  The Master took the fifth (it being the most
hideously oddstruck) and the performers generally agreed that it was
the hardest performance they had yet endured.  The band stood in the
order: Mr I Renyard 1, Mr P Renyard 2, Mr I C Moore 3, Mr A Clark
(non member) 4, Mr C J Cooper 5, Mr Chittenden-Pile 6.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">The
Master claimed 5 blood-blisters as battle scars.  The Company then
adjourned to the Masters house for rest and refreshment, thus ending
a memorable day.</font></font></p><p class="western" align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="5"><b>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b></font></font></p><p class="western" align="center"></p><p class="western" align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="5"><b></b></font></font></p><p class="western" align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="5"><b>Ancient

<p class="western"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">Proceedings
began at 3:45pm, when Mr &amp; Mrs Pearson arrived with their
handbells, and a course of Bob Minor was rung at James Barham&rsquo;s
grave, remembering the great works which he had wrought in his
lifetime; 1-2 Mrs G. Pearson, 3-4 F. Pearson Esq, 5-6 C.J. Cooper
Esq.  Following this, a quarter Peal of Bob Minor was attempted on
the back six tower bells by Society members.  Sadly this came to
grief due to an aberration by the conductor.  A short service of
Evensong according to the Book of Common Prayer followed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western"> 
</p>
<h1 class="western">THE DINNER</h1>
<p class="western"><img style="width: 417px; height: 287px;" alt="" src="dleedsannprocess.jpg"><br>
</p>
<p class="western">Following the service, a select group of members
and friends departed for Leeds Castle.  The Master, Superintending
Beadle and Steward (for the purposes of the Dinner) processed from
Church to Castle; the Superintending Beadle leading the way and
carrying the Society mace.  Because of his great age, the Chief
Beadle, Mr S. Russel was unable to attend.  Those attending Dinner
arrived one by one at the Gatehouse, and drinks were served in the
reception hall.   At 7:30 pm, the Company sat down to a fine Dinner
having sung the &lsquo;Grace&rsquo;.  A Red Onion and Calvados Soup made for
an appetising starter, followed by sumptious Roast Saddle of Lamb
with all the trimmings.  Dessert of Hot Apple and Blackberry Pie with
Cream rounded off an exquisite menu.  Dinner concluded, the Leeds
Youths service of Thanksgiving - designed especially to mark the
250<sup>th</sup> Anniversary year &ndash; ensued.  Mrs F. Hardy at the
Organ, and the Lessons from the Authorised Version of the Bible were
read by The Master, and  Mr D.P. Smith.  Amongst the hymns sung was
the Office Hymn for Christmas, &lsquo;Come Thou Redeemer of the Earth&rsquo;
with melody by Michael Praetorius.  At the Conclusion the National
Anthem was sung. 
</p>
<p class="western">  
</p>
<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">The
Service concluded, Mr D.P. Smith took the opportunity to present the
Master with a Christmas gift, superbly wrapped.  The Master thanked
Mr Smith for his generosity, and displayed the fine gift, a framed
picture of York Minster.  Later it was decided that this should be
displayed in the Ringing Room at Leeds Church, so that all might
enjoy it.</font></font></font></font></p><p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><img style="width: 412px; height: 276px;" alt="" src="dleedsanndinner.jpg">  </font></font></font></font>
</p>

<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">The
final formality was for the Master to deliver his annual speech to
the assembled Company.   He said that he believed that the members
had worked very hard this year to maintain the highest standards. 
Sadly, success had eluded the Company on 2<sup>nd</sup> November
where a peal was attempted to mark the first on the bells exactly 250
years before.  Congratulations were due to the other band, drawn from
members of the Kent Association of Ringers who  accomplished their
peal on 1<sup>st</sup> November.</font></font></font></font></p><p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><img style="width: 412px; height: 284px;" alt="" src="dleedsanndinner2.jpg">  </font></font></font></font>
</p>

<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">The
Master then reminded the assembled members that the art of
concentration was of the utmost importance.  It was unfortunate that
many finely struck peal attempts in the name of the Society since its
re-establishment, had come to grief usually near the end due to
momentary lapses of concentration resulting in a shift in course.  He
said he wondered if there was any band left who could still ring a
faultless 15,840 of Kent Treble Bob Major.  How wonderful it was that
Kent Treble Bob was the invention of the Leeds Youths, and became the
zenith of achievement for all the great 19<sup>th</sup> century
bands; and oh what a pity that so many these days had such a feeble
grounding in a method such as this, which disciplines the mind to
concentration.  Leeds Youths, he remarked, should be disciplined and
well ordered, with an ability to ring such methods as Treble Bob in
both Kent and Oxford Variations, and, of course, Mr Stedman&rsquo;s
Principle and maintain concentration throughout, to avoid unfortunate
shifts in course.  He felt very strongly that it should be the duty
of every band member to keep right, and warned against the path of
having a clever conductor to keep the rest of the band right.  This,
he believed, sometimes resulted in low standards of striking, and
persons quite unable to learn and strike more complex methods,  being
continually assisted by a conductor.  He also wondered why so many
are obsessed these days with unmusical and unremarkable
Surprise/Delight/Alliance methods, where he felt that London (London
No 1 on 10 bells and Londinium on 12 bells), Bristol (on all numbers)
and Superlative (Major only) were the only standard, excepting only
the more modern, clever, and musical 12 bell methods such as Orion
and Avon.  He then went on to thank members for their support, and
stated that the Society must be sure to achieve the Peal of 6480
Quators at Leeds in 2002.  In  concluding, he remarked on several
instances in the past year where various ringers around the country
had attempted to injure the Society by various means, and
particularly in regard to the large amount of nonsense - rubbishing
the ancient ideals of the Society - which could be found on a Ringing
Chat archive on the internet.  He believed that this sort of rubbish 
should be looked on as a triumph for the Society, for it clearly
demonstrated the stolid intellects of the several writers, and how
severely life-threatening many people find such a Society as the
Leeds Youths which strives for higher ideals than the majority these
days.  He suggested that the company should go forth with a firm
resolve into their 251<sup>st</sup> year and keep the Sunday Service
ringing as a priority.  All else would follow on from there, and high
points of 2002 would include celebration of the bicentenary of the
casting of Borden bells where the &lsquo;go&rsquo; of them has been greatly
improved by recent maintenance carried out by Society members, (the
first peal on the bells was rung by the Leeds Youths); and the Golden
Jubilee of the Queen was an occasion which the Master highlighted as
a major occasion particularly dear to our Society which swears fealty
to &lsquo;the Church&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Crown&rsquo;.</font></font></font></font></p>

<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">The
remainder of the evening was spent ringing tunes and basic
changeringing on handbells, and that so enthusiastically, that the
planned &lsquo;Old Time Music Hall&rsquo; renditions had to be cut from the
programme.  Nevertheless, it is certain that these will receive a
hearty airing at the 251<sup>st</sup> Anniversary Dinner!</font></font></font></font></p><p class="western"><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua,serif;">--------------------------------------------------------o0o-----------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="western"><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua,serif;"></span></p><h2><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua,serif;"></span>254th Anniversary Dinner; Saturday 10th December 2005.</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>The
254th Anniversary Supper proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable occasion,
as ever. &nbsp;The Supper held at the Park Gate Inn (situated without
the gates of &nbsp;Leeds Castle Park) was the usual traditional
Christmas menu which the members have come to expect. &nbsp;The loyal
toast to HM Queen Elizabeth II was proposed by the Master and drunk
heartily by her loyal subjects there assembled.<br><br><img style="width: 378px; height: 301px;" alt="" src="2005anndinner2.jpg"><br>&nbsp;<br>The
Master then proceeded with the toast to the Memory of the first past
Master James Barham. &nbsp;The Master's speech this year focussed on
the wondrous Christmas Season 'now in the time of this mortal life in
which God's son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility', and
then contrasted this with what we all now happens just a few months
later in the acts leading up to Good Friday where Judas Iscariot
betrays Christ. &nbsp;Finally he reminded all the members to 'keep
watch; for ye know not at which hour the Lord cometh' so 'that in the
last day when He shall come in His glorious majesty to judge both the
quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal whoever liveth and
reigneth with God and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 408px; height: 327px;" alt="" src="2005anndinner1.jpg"><img style="width: 411px; height: 328px;" alt="" src="2005anndinner3.jpg"></div><br>The
