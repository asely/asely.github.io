      <h1 align="center">History of the Leeds Youths</h1>



      
      
      
      <p>In 1751 the Lenham Youths opened the bells of St. Nicholas, Leeds by
      ringing the first peal on the ten bells.&nbsp; The peal was of Bob Quators
      on November 2<sup>nd</sup>, and was followed by an 8100 of Bob Royal on
      November 30th.&nbsp; All members of the Lenham
      Youths were so impressed with Leeds' newly augmented ring of ten that the
      decision was made to remove their headquarters from Harrietsham to this magnificent
      tower.&nbsp; To complete the transition, the Society was also renamed, The
      Leeds Youths on or about 12th December, when 6480 Bob Quators was rung as
      the first peal by The Leeds Youths.
      </p>


      
      
      <p>96 peals of over 5000 changes were rung for the Leeds Youths between 1751 and
      1840 (though many of the Trebble Bob compositions had internal falseness).&nbsp; In
      1753 they rang 20,160 changes of Plain Bob Major and over
      Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup> April 1761 and Wednesday 8<sup>th</sup> April 1761,
      the company rang 40,320 changes - the entire extent - of Plain Bob Major in
      27 hours.</p>


      
      
      <p>Away from home, the Leeds Youths also rang peals on other fine
      peals of Kent bells.&nbsp; This included peals at Harrietsham (the
      previous headquarters, where they returned for a number of peals), Dover
      (where, incidentally the very first peal ever rung in Kent was performed
      by the Dover company in 1729 - the back seven bells still presently
      retaining their original sound), Cranbrook, Goudhurst and Chiddingstone.&nbsp;
      Their services were called upon to open the bells with the first peals at
      Ashford (augmented from a Hatch 6 to an eight with two Lester &amp; Pack
      trebles) in 1763, at Elham in 1764, at Maidstone in 1784 (a new Chapman
      &amp; Mears 10, where the second ever peal of Kent Treble Bob Royal was
      rung - though the company also rang two peals on the previous ring of 8
      here too-) at Eltham where they scored the first peal on the bells
      subsequent to the Society of College Youths failed attempt, and at Borden
      in 1803, where they lost the peal after 4000-and-some changes, though they
      went back the following year and scored the first peal; Oxford T.B.
      Major.&nbsp; They obviously held these bells in high regard (as we do
      presently) as they returned on several subsequent occasions for peals
      here.</p>


      
      
      <p>The Leeds Youths - possibly James Barham himself - also invented a
      new Treble Bob variation, known to us today as Kent.&nbsp; They named it
      New Treble Bob, and although generally rubbished by the 'establishment'
      today (generally because of peoples inability to concentrate on such a
      pure Treble Bob Method), it was very highly regarded by all worthy ringing
      societies in the 19th century, taking its place as the zenith of methods
      for some considerable period, and with a far more obvious coursing order
      than Oxford T.B, though Oxford is obviously also a fine method.&nbsp; The
      esteem in which Kent was held by the greatest ringers of all time is
      evident in the fact that the first peal of Maximus at St Paul's Cathedral
      London was in the Kent variation, with Messrs W.T. Cockerill and W. Prime
      on the Tenor and rung for Ancient Society of College Youths.&nbsp; Not
      until 1925 was any Maximus method other than Kent pealed on those
      bells.&nbsp; At St Matthew Bethnal Green, too, a 15,840 of Kent&nbsp; was
      rung in 1861 by Ancient Society of College Youths - the longest peal at
      that time by one set of men - 9h 48 min.&nbsp; The current day membership
      wonder how many could achieve such a long length of Kent today without
      falling off the line.&nbsp; As for the history of Kent, both the first
      peals of&nbsp; Major and Royal were rung by The Leeds Youths at Leeds
      respectively on June 5th 1774, and January 5th 1778. </p>


      
      
      <p>The tale of the
      competition between the Leeds Youths and Wye Youths is also of great
      historical interest, and can be found as a <a href="leedswyecontest.html"><u>separate article</u>.</a></p>


      
      
      <p>Other
      notable achievements by the Company consisted of a peal in 1788, noted in
      the peal book as "rung by eight young hands".&nbsp; The youngest
      performer was 63 and the tenor man was 82 - the method: Bob Major!&nbsp;
      In 1813, James Barham rang his last peal, Bob Major on the Treble, at the
      age of 88, and passed away in 1819 aged 94.&nbsp; Only a few weeks before
      his death he had rung about 800 Bob Major on the Treble!&nbsp; After
      Barham's death, there were various attempts to keep the Leeds Youths
      active, but it inevitably declined, and the last peal for the Leeds Youths
      was in 1830, Kent Treble Bob Royal.&nbsp; Between 1830 and about 1890, the
      bells were seldom rung (except by visiting Ancient Society of College
      Youths bands for peals - one of which rung in the 1850's is a good example
      of the considerable effort that ringers put into the art in those days,
      and can be found in a separate article)&nbsp; Usually two men were
      required for the Tenor; the bells having had so many peals rung on them
      and no major restoration since their installation in 1751.&nbsp; We are
      led to believe that there may have been an unsatisfactory rehang in 1898,
      but not until 1911 was the re-hanging exercise bestowed upon that genius
      of bellhanging, Mr Alfred Bowell of Ipswich.&nbsp; The fact that 90 years
      on, the bells are still in a very satisfactory ringing condition is
      testimony to the quality of his workmanship.&nbsp; He would also retain as
      much of the original installation as possible - thus the frame is original
      - Robert Catlin 1751, and only the seventh and ninth have been recast; the
      others were not tuned, and therefore sound as they did when the Leeds
      Youths performed their ringing upon them.&nbsp; Mr Bowell also gave the
      back eight new steel girder headstocks (having sadly removed the canons of
      the back 8) and new bearings, and adapted what look to be the original
      clappers (a very good idea, for the quality of wrought iron in the 18th
      century is far superior to the shameful 'SG' sound which has spoilt many a
      good installation)</p>


      
      
      <p>It was with some amazement that when the Leeds Youths was
re-established in 1999 as the Ancient Society of Esquire Leeds Youths,
the members discovered that no previous attempts had been made to
re-establish a bona-fide Society.&nbsp; Between mid-2000 Easter 2004,
the bells wer rung almost every Sunday for morning service by the
ASELY.&nbsp; The ASELY is restricted to male membership only, but makes
no apology for this.&nbsp; The members believe that, particularly
following the destruction of most other old ringing societies, it is
important that there should be just one where members should be capable
of ringing to a high standard, but also support the traditional Church
(Male Ministers, and the 1662 Book of Common Prayer) and conduct
themselves with dignity.&nbsp; Membership is only open to persons who
can fulfill these criteria, but as an added device against political
correctness we should also like to state that all Sunday service
ringing ASELY members are also members of the <a href="handbellhist.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leeds</span></a><a href="handbellhist.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Society of Bell &amp; Handbell Ringers</span></a>,
which is dedicated to ensuring that any local persons who wish to
content themselves with handling a bell and ringing called-changes may
do so, and which is also the group which rings the Parish Church Handbells sold
by the Church upon erroneous advice in the late 1930's, and which were
discovered in an Antique shop in Hungerford in 2003, and bought back by
the Parochial Church Council, upon the recommendation of the then
Vicar, supported by the Master of the Leeds Youths. &nbsp;Membership of
this Society is open to Male and Female.&nbsp;</p>
