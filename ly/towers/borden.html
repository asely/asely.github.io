            some over-zealous tightening of those bolts several years ago by a
            ringer from a neighbouring parish who had bypassed the tower captain
            and gone straight through the church authorities.&nbsp; Sadly, this
            work which was supposedly necessary to make the bells safe to ring
            has in fact worsened their state.&nbsp; An expert in mechanics
            advised the ASELY that metal plates must be fitted between the nuts
            and the tops of the headstocks.&nbsp; The ASELY placed an order for
            these through the tower captain, and resolved that this work must be
            carried out, and at the same time painting of all the metalwork,
            tightening of all bolts securing frame to foundation beams, and
            restoration of Ellacombe chime hammers, and new terylene ropes for
            the Ellacombe mechanism.&nbsp; This work to be completed in

            the headstock on the third to eliminate movement which had caused a
            terrible banging sound to be heard and a great shaking of the frame
            to be seen when the bell was turned over (the bell had never been
            hitting the frame as suggested by some, who had never bothered to
            investigate properly!)&nbsp; Boards were also fixed up the side of
            the frame on the 3rd and Tenor to guide the ropes straight down to
            the ringing room (whereas the ropes had previously fallen slower
            than the wheels had turned which led to a snaking and jumping effect
            on the ropes)&nbsp; Adding the guides also meant that the Tenor
            sally could be moved up to a height whereby it was easier to
            ring.&nbsp; Six extents of Minor were rung (without too great an
            effort being&nbsp; required) on the back 6 on February 2nd (an
            unsuccessful peal attempt) to mark the Bicentenary of the casting of
            the bells and the centenary of a peal marking (what was then) the
