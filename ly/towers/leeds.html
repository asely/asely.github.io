Long history of a large choir - in 2005 there are now five members (including the Master of the ASELY)<br>




Following a steady decline
in
congregation, and a corresponding dissatisfaction by the regular Sunday
service ringers at the attitude of one particular clergyman,
particularly with regard to the bad manners of allowing certain
officials with a personal grudge against the Society and its aims to
inspect the bells and write scurrilous reports, members of the Society
resolved that the Master should write a firm letter to the Cleric in
question, and that we would try and ring for the retimed service on the
1st Sunday of the month, but that we would therefore not ring for the
service on the 2nd Sunday, as it was a 'FAMILY SERVICE' - which
fulfilled no useful purpose&nbsp;as it was very rare for any families
or children to be present. &nbsp;There was also a deliberate ploy to
sideline the (already only occasional) Choral Matins services.
&nbsp;The response which members&nbsp;expected to their letter was one
of discussion and concern at our upset. &nbsp;However, it suited this
Cleric to reappoint one Christopher R. Saunders as Tower Captain (C.R.
Saunders had resigned as Captain during the Incumbency of Rev Brookes
after a disagreement with regard to low standards of ringing on
Sundays; the ASELY taking over a couple of years after this
disagreement and ringing to a much higher standard)
without any consultation with the ASELY. &nbsp;It seems that C.R.
Saunders was instructed to collect the key for the tower from a lady
parishioner, and that he and others removed all the ASELY property from the
tower, and dumped
it outside the residence of the ASELY Master on the night of Friday August 6th 2004. &nbsp;The Cleric - who
claims that he did not give authorisation for the removal of the
property and dumping at the Master's front door, one Rev. Robin Gill,
who also <a href="Euth.doc"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">spoke in the House of Lords in favour of a bill to legalise Euthanasia</span></a> in late 2004 - sent a letter
to the Master of ASELY which arrived on Saturday 7th August 'thanking
him for his services'. &nbsp;The Society began a massive Campaign
through the Press to regain their Headquarters Tower.<a href="../history/thetruth.html"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TO READ THE TRUE DETAILS OF THIS STORY PLEASE CLICK THIS LINK </span></a></div>
