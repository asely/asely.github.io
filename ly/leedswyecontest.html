<h1 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The 1755 ringing contest between the Wye Company and Leeds Youths</h1>
<br>
At the time of the altercations between the Leeds Youths and Wye
Company, the Leeds Youths had only been extant for four years, under
their 29 year-old Master James Barham, whereas the Wye Ringers had been
peal ringing since at least the 1730's.<br>
<br>
It is clear that, probably due to the poor standards of ringing by the
Wye Company, the Leeds Youths were deeply unimpressed by them, and
viewed them with all the disdain which a young and dedicated band
striving for excellence may have for an older group of ringers with
lower standards of striking, who believe that they have a divine right
to 'lord it' over all other ringers, leaving a facade of
respectability, when in fact these supposedly 'older statesman' were
nothing but a bunch of what we might now term as 'slashers' or
'hackers'.&nbsp; The present day Leeds Youths have every reason to
empathise with their brethren of olden time, as they are now holding
their own, not against the company of Wye ringers, (who nowadays are a
very amiable band of souls - generally uninterested in changeringing,
but very keen and dedicated Sunday service ringers in a church with an
excellent choral tradition, and which boasts an electoral roll of over
300, many of whom would probably attend the Parish Church in Ashford
were it not for the terrible modernising of the main Sunday service
there, and divers 'politicking') but against certain members of the
Kent County Association of Change Ringers, who simply cannot<span style="font-style: italic;"> bear</span>
the idea of a band of Youths who will not be brought to heel by them,
as those KCACR members of whom we speak&nbsp;think they have a divine
right to 'lord it' over our Society, and to try to crush it as they
perceive a threat, where none originally existed - save against the
modernisation or removal of traditional church furnishings, bell frames
and fittings, or modernisation of Church of England doctrine and
liturgy into meaningless tripe.<br>
<br>
Returning to our story, it is probable that the Leeds ringers first
encountered the Wye Company in 1749 when the Leeds Youths were still
called the Lenham Youths, and&nbsp; had their Headquarters at
Harrietsham.&nbsp; Both the Lenham Youths and Wye Company were invited
to open the Faversham bells - the Lenham Youths scoring a peal but,
according to James Barham "Wye ringers were here at the same time, but
rang nothing to speak of at all".<br>
<br>
It came to pass in November 1754, that both bands (the Lenham Youths
now being the Leeds Youths) attempted peals on the bells of Wrotham
Parish Church on separate dates.&nbsp; The Wye attempt failed, but the
Leeds Youths were triumphant. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Kentish Post (Canterbury Newsletter)</span> [which was published bi-weekly - on Wednesday and Saturday] for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday 30th November 1754</span> James Barham inserted a notice in the Advertisement column:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">On
Wednesday November 20th in the evening at St Nicholas Leeds, the Youths
of Leeds rang 5040 Double Bob Major in 3 hours and 16 minutes; and the
Friday following the same Youths rang at Wrotham on that celebrated new
peal of bells a compleat Peal of 5040 Bob Major in 3 hours and 18
minutes although a famous antient Company of Ringers in Kent attempted
at Grandsire Triples and Bob Major, but their peals were short; their
complaint was that the bells went badly but we could see no foundation
for such complaint.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
A response was forthcoming from the Wye ringers on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wednesday 11th December:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whereas
a paragraph was inserted in a late Canterbury Newspaper, reflecting on
an ancient and famous Company of Ringers in Kent for not going thro' a
5040 at Wrotham, and as there are a great many ancient and famous
Companies of Ringers in this County, every one may not know who is
meant thereby; but as the Wye Company were at Wrotham about that Time,
and had not their usual Success, it is probable they may be the Company
that is meant; if not they beg Pardon; but if they be, this is their
Answer:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEEDS&nbsp;</span> Youths.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gentlemen:</span>
THIS is to acquaint you that notwithstanding the shortness of our Peals
at Wrotham, we are ready to ring with you whenever you please.&nbsp; We
are not ancient, neither do we esteem our selves famous, yet we have
rung more whole Peals in Kent and Sussex, than ever you will do if you
live to the age of the Antediluvians.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">At half of which Places</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tho' you're just in your Prime</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Whene'er you beat us</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">We'll leave off - 'twill be Time.</span> <br>
</div>
<br>
Then from the Leeds Youths on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday 28th December:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To the Company of Ringers at Wye:<br>
&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">GENTLEMEN, YOU</span> have very
good Reason to suppose that a late Advertisement in this paper might
probably be levelled at you. - We the Leeds Youths very readily
acknowledge our Fault in speaking of you in a Language that you don't
deserve; for whereas we stiled you an antient and famous Company of
Ringers we are forced now to agree with you that, although you may be
antient, you certainly are not famous, but rather, infamous Ringers,
whatever your other accomplishments may be.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">As we can gain no Honour by engaging
with you so soon after your miserable Performance at Wrotham, we
recommend to your practice, Bob Major, which was never executed but by
us; and when you have made some tolerable progress in that, we shall
then be ready to accept of any Challenge from you - But fear you will
never be able to accomplish it, were you to live to the days of
Methuselah.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
We can note from these two communications that both Barham and the Wye
author were keen to present themselves as well educated in Classic
Literature.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wed 1st January 1755:</span><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
To the Leeds Ringers, alias Pretenders to Ringing, alias Blunderers:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">You have great Reason to boast of
your Ringing, when you have never a Man in your Place could ring a
Course of Cators.&nbsp; As to your Billingsgate Stuff in the paper, it
corresponds with your Scandalous Behaviour at Wrotham; your ringing
there was the worst that ever was heard; and since, you perform'd most
wretchedly.&nbsp; That you are sensible to your Insufficiency to ring
with us is plain, by your equivocating and ridiculous Answer,
consisting of nothing but Impertinence.&nbsp; But what could we expect
from a Parcel of conceited Fools, who never heard any Ringers but
themselves, and consequently never heard a good Peal? O! poor Bob
Major!&nbsp; You have used him cruelly at Leeds; you finally condemned
him at Wrotham; and you have <span style="font-weight: bold;">executed</span> him at Lenham. </span><br>
</div>
&nbsp;<br>
Whilst the sentiments of the Wye letter are entirely to be deprecated,
it has to be conceded that the author had a very fluent grasp of
literature, much&nbsp; more so than Barham.&nbsp; In these modern
times, it is the current Master of the Leeds Youths who puts his
antagonisers to shame in the literary stakes, due mainly to the
appalling standards of education in England from the 1960's onwards.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
Wed 15th January 1755:</span><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
To the Wye Ringers:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gentlemen,</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are surpriz'd
you should say we have never a Man that can ring a Course of Cators;
for Dec. 12th, 1751 we rung 6480 Cators and Jan. 25th, 1752 we rung
7200 Ten-in.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't pretend
to equal you in Scurrility; we profess Ringing and not Scolding.&nbsp;
If you really intend any Thing besides Words, we are ready to </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">give you a meeting and ingage in such
Peal, and for such a Sum as shall be agreed upon.&nbsp; But if you only
love to hear yourselves talk, we shall not trouble ourselves to answer
you.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday 25th Jan 1755:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To the Leeds Ringers:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gentlemen</span>,</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retrospecting upon
the whole Affair, we think you exceeded us in Scurrility - we are sorry
we attempted to imitate you, and do with pleasure drop it. - With
regard to Cators you charge us with Mendaciloquence, when your Men
confess'd they had never rung it. - We take no delight in Loquacity,
neither are we fond of Altercations.&nbsp; We will therefore, if you
please, meet you at the Swan in Charing on Saturday the first day of
February next, at Two of the Clock, and end the Dispute by ringing with
you, at Wye and Leeds; agree upon a Peal or Peals, and stake the Money
to be rung for.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">From your humble Servants,</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Wye Ringers.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday 27th January</span>
the Wye Company, as practice for the contest which they were expecting
rang 5040 Double Bob Major at Wye and published their success in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Kentish Post'.</span><br>
<br>
The Leeds Youths and Wye Company met at the Swan, Charing on Saturday
February 1st and resolved: that they should meet at Leeds on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday 24th</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">February</span> and at Wye on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Monday 24th March.</span>&nbsp;
The test-piece would be 5040 Bob Major for each band, and that each
band would put half a Guinea on each man.&nbsp; Half a Guinea would
have been about 2 weeks wages to James Barham, who was Head Gardener to
Lord Fairfax at Leeds Castle; so a considerable amount of money was at
stake, as well as the Honour of the Leeds Youths.<br>
<br>
The Leeds Youths took the competition with greater seriousness than the
Wye Company, and rang two practice peals of 5040 Bob Major - one on  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday10th February</span>, and the other on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday 22nd February</span>,
but unlike the Wye Youths, they did not feel the need to boast about
these peals in the columns of the Paper, rather contenting themselves
to wait until the competition piece.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday 15th February 1755</span>, the Landlord of the George Inn at Leeds had the following notice inserted in the 'Kentish Post':<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As
the Leeds Youths and Wye Company of Ringers have come to an Agreement
to ring at Leeds and Wye; this is to inform the Publick, that they will
ring the first Time at Leeds on Monday the 24th of this instant
February for a considerable Sum of Money.&nbsp; N.B. There will be a
good Twelve-penny Ordinary on the Table at one o'Clock at the Sign of
the George.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
<h3>And so it was that on Monday 24th February 1755, the Leeds Youths
rang a peal of 5040 Bob Major in 3hours and 10 minutes on their bells,
but the Wye Company fired their peal out a little before the
half-way.&nbsp; Many folk came to listen to the contest, and it was
clear that the Wye Company were not nearly as competent as the Leeds
Youths.</h3>
<br>
The 'return leg' of the competition was in fact postponed until <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday 26th May 1755</span>, and the following account inserted by Robert Quested of the Kings Head, Wye in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Kentish Post'</span> explains this and outlines the revised date for the contest:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wednesday May 7th 1755 :<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;This is to acquaint the
Publick, That the Small-Pox is intirely out of Wye, and hath been so
for a Month past; And that the Ringing Match between Wye and Leeds that
hath been delayed upon the aforesaid Account, will be rung on Monday
the 26th of this Instant. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">N.B.</span> There will be a good Ordinary at One of the Clock the same day at Robert Quested's at the King's Head in Wye.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
And finally on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday 24th May</span> the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Kentish Post'</span> announced:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Notwithstanding all Reports to the contrary the Ringing Match will be at Wye on Monday next as appointed.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
The final report in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Kentish Post'</span> for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wednesday 28th May</span> tells us:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3><span style="font-style: italic;">That the Youths of Leeds did ring
their peal of 5040 Bob Major at Wye, and thus beat the Wye Company both
at Home and Abroad, to the great Dishonour of that Company.</span></h3>
</div>
<br>
The Wye ringers, as good as their word, never rang another peal; the
Leeds Youths were victorious, and their great achievements continued
for over 60 years more.<br>
