The
music which we use for playing the Hymns and Carols on the bells was
all transcribed (and in some cases transposed) very excellently by the Master's mother,&nbsp; Mrs J. Cooper.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">December 2006</span>:
&nbsp;Carols were rung again on the Leeds handbells at The Bell,
Ivychurch, The Prince of Wales, New Romney, The Romney Grill on the
occasion of the New Romney Parish Church Christmas Supper, The Red Lion
Inn in Snargate, and outside The George Inn, Leeds, &nbsp;Over
&pound;40 was raised for the Church, exclusive of the Carol Singing at
the George in Leeds, where a large quantity of money was raised, but
this was not included in the monies handed to the PCC for repayment of
the handbell loan.<br>
      <br>
December 2007: Carols were rung on the Leeds handbells at The Red Lion,
Snargate and The Prince of Wales New Romney on 20th December.
&nbsp;This followed a very convivial practice at the home of David
Jackson, New Romney Tower Captain. &nbsp;Four of the ten carols in our
repertoire were recorded on video, and these appear below:<br>
