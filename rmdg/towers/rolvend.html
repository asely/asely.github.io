      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1819 &ndash; A new ring of eight was cast
      for the tower by Thomas Mears the younger.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1820 &ndash; A new band formed as soon as
      the bells were installed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
      under 12 months, with only the help of only a book about the art, the band
      scored their first <u>peal</u>; Bob Triples in November.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>The conductor was Edward Lansdell (Junr.) [aged 19] who became a
      very accomplished ringer and a member of what was known for a short time
      as the Sussex Society (Ringers of St Saviours, Southwark).<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>They subsequently renamed themselves the (Junior) Society of
      College Youths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
      societies had broken away from the older College Youths who believed that
      the younger ringers were not of a suitable class to be members of their
      Society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a time the two
      Societies united, as the Ancient Society of College Youths, and have been
      known as such ever since.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1821 &ndash; In February the same band (made
      up mainly of Lansdell&rsquo;s and Goble&rsquo;s) scored a <u>peal of Union Triples</u>,
      again conducted by Edward Lansdell (Junr.)</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1822 &ndash; In February the same band rang
      a <u>peal of Grandsire Triples</u>, with Edward Lansdell (Junr.) again
      acting as conductor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all
      these peals Edward Lansdell (Senr.) rang the Tenor.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>He was the Father of the other Lansdell&rsquo;s in the band, and to
      make matters even more complicated, it appears from the <u>gravestones in
      the Churchyard</u> that <i style="">his</i> Father was <i style="">also</i> called
      Edward!</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1827 &ndash; The tenor was recast by Thomas
      Mears the younger.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1833 &ndash; 1870&rsquo;s - By 1833 Edward
      Lansdell (Junr.) had become a ringer at St Saviour, Southwark (now
      Southwark Cathedral), as a peal board records him as calling a peal of
      Stedman Quators at <u>Leeds, Kent</u> in that year.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>There were two men required on the Tenor.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Lansdell died sometime during the 1870&rsquo;s or 1880&rsquo;s.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>He had been in most of the ground-breaking performances of the
      College Youths, including the <u>8580 Stedman Cinques at St Michael,
      Cornhill</u>, when aged 60.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1844 &ndash; George Lansdell was evidently
      also involved with the College Youths.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>A peal board shows that he rang the tenor behind to a <u>peal of
      Grandsire Triples</u> in this year at Rolvenden.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>The conductor was George Stockham, handbell founder at Whitechapel
      Foundry (who also had two trebles cast for Hythe in 1860, and then
      chiselled the inscriptions off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
      tried to pass them off as his own work, but they were so out of tune with
      the other bells at Hythe because of his tampering, that they were scrapped
      at Whitechapel in 1891 to defray the cost of recasting the Tenor at Hythe)<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Stockham was also a member of the band in the <u><a href="../../ety/towers/gallery/bethgrn/beth07.jpg">8580 at Cornhill.</a><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1890&rsquo;s &ndash; The Kent County Association
      scored several <u>peals</u> at Rolvenden.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1899 &ndash; A peal is recorded on a board
      in the tower by the KCA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
      board</u> is an identical design to one at Appledore in 1901, and supports
      the supposition that the foundation of a District Guild was very much in
      the minds of ringers from the surrounding areas.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1905 &ndash; The <u>first peal</u> rung at
      Rolvenden for the RM &amp; DG &ndash; Grandsire Triples.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>A couple of <u>other boards</u> on the walls also record peals by
      the Guild.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Guild rang
      many peals here, and had several active members in the local band who took
      part in eight bell peals at Rolvenden and elsewhere.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1920's &ndash; Bells quarter turned and
      rehung on plain bearings.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1996 &ndash; The bells were removed from the
      tower, the old wheels and headstocks disposed of, the canons cut off, and
      the bells rehung in the old frame on new metal headstocks and ball
      bearings with<span style="">&nbsp; </span>independent SG clappers.</p>
