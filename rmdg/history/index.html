      <p align="justify">This Guild has had an interesting history, and it
      became clear to a number of ringers who ring frequently in the Romney
      Marsh and surrounding area that the re-establishment of this useful
      society in 1999 - after lying dormant for about 60 years - could only aid
      the then poor state of ringing in the aforementioned area. Thus two years
      on, Members of the Guild see a great improvement in the standard and
      amount of ringing occurring at towers in the area. At Woodchurch there is
      a young band in training; at Mersham all but one of the band are members
      of the Guild, and all 8 bells are rung weekly for practice and Sunday
      Service. At Appledore, members of the Guild have attended practices weekly
      to assist those taking their first steps in method ringing. At Burmarsh
      the Guild organises a monthly practice and also ringing for the monthly
      Sunday Evensong. At Hothfield too, the local band are all Guild members,
      and the bells were recently overhauled once again. The bells are rung for
      practice on 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> Thursday, adjourning to
      Little Chart for a brief practice to keep this tiny six going, followed by
      the Swan Inn. The Hothfield branch of the Guild attends Divine Service at
      Hothfield on 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> Sunday and ring after the
      service.</p>


      
      
      <p align="justify">The present criteria for membership is that a candidate
      for membership must be able to ring 120 changes in any method which does
      not contain four blows in any one place in the plain course, and therefore
      one which is not in breach of the original rules of the Central Council.
      So far this year, the guild has achieved Quarter Peals in Grandsire
      Triples (taken from Holts Original), Superlative S. Major and Bob Minor.</p>


      
      
      <p align="justify">At the second Committee Meeting of the Guild on
      Wednesday August 8<sup>th</sup> 2001 in The Farriers Arms, Mersham the
      following elections took place: Miss V. Gates Van-Dijke (Mersham)
      Mistress; Mr C.J. Cooper (Mersham/Ashford/Leeds/Hothfield) Secretary; Mr
      P.A. Renyard (Mersham/Ashford/Leeds/Hothfield) Treasurer. Committee
      Members are: Mr I.A. Renyard (Hothfield/Ashford/Mersham/Leeds); Mr D.H.
      Gower (Cheriton/Hothfield) and Mr J. H. Lane (Ashford).</p>


      
      
      <p align="justify">As from January 2002, particularly bearing in mind that
      there are now over 30 members on the books, it is intended to hold monthly
      Guild practices at towers in the area for the practice and teaching of
      change-ringing.</p>


      
      
      <p align="justify">Turning now to the history of the Guild, the Secretary
      has only recently begun to look in detail for historical material
      appertaining to the activities of the RM &amp;DG. He does recall, however,
      that during the cleaning work which he carried out in the Ringing Room of
      New Romney tower in the mid 90&rsquo;s, he found an old RM &amp; DG meeting
      invitation card in a pile of rubbish which lay in a hollow passage in the
      belfry. The last time he visited the tower, it had been removed, and it
      would indeed be interesting to study this card in detail if anyone knows
      its whereabouts. The only real documentary evidence of the RM &amp;DG,
      which the Secretary has as yet found, is that contained in reports in the
      old Ringing World editions at times when the Guild was in a strong
      position. Any original peal books, name or account books have not as yet
      been traced. Little history has yet been found of the Guild&rsquo;s activity
      over the first ten years or so, and unless anyone can supply &lsquo;concrete
      evidence&rsquo; which disproves these largely conjectural theories, then they
      will stand until further research confirms or dismisses them.</p>

      <p align="justify">It is assumed then that the recasting of Appledore
      bells into 8 by Messrs John Warner &amp; Son in October 1900 was done with
      the express intention of increasing the opportunities for furthering the
      art in the area. The only other rings of eight in the immediate area were
      at New Romney where Mr H.S. Humphery was so influential and hardworking in
      cultivating a band, and at Tenterden, where that famous old ringer Mr C.
      Tribe &lsquo;pointed the way&rsquo;. We can therefore assume that the work at
      Appledore kindled in the minds of at least the two aforementioned
      Gentlemen, and probably a great many others, the desire for a local Guild
      which could draw ringers from eight bell towers further afield too &ndash;
      Rye, Brighton, Hawkhurst, Benenden, Mersham, Ashford and Rolvenden. In the event
      the Guild also drew members from quite some way outside the District;
      Hythe and Lyminge (The Choirmaster and Organist at that Church, Dr William
      E. Pitman was a very loyal supporter).</p>


      
      
      <p align="justify">Although the Secretary has not yet found much
      information about the RM &amp; DG other than the peal boards (the first
      Guild peal was in 1903 at New Romney), he has just finished researching
      the year 1913 from The Ringing World. Appended are details of the meetings
      held, which it is hoped will be of some little interest.</p>

      </b><i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>January: Appledore.</u></i> This was the important
      Annual Festival of the Guild. 25 members were present, though there was
      only time for a few touches of Grandsire Triples before the service, which
      was conducted by the Vicar, Rev A.O. Scutt. At 6 o&rsquo;clock the members
      adjourned to the Swan Hotel for a meat tea. At the Annual Meeting held
      after tea, the Balance sheet showed a balance of &pound;1 15s 3d, and the Hon.
      Secretary reported that the membership had been steadily increasing &ndash;
      there were now 42 members on the books. In 1912 they had held 12 meetings
      and an outing, which was the greatest number since the Guild&rsquo;s
      formation. The Officers were all re-elected for the forthcoming year: Rev
      A.O. Scutt (Appledore) President; Mr G. Billeness (Rye) Master; and
      Gilbert J. Youngs (Rye) Hon. Secretary. Following the Meeting, there was
      musical entertainment rendered by members and others, and courses of
      Grandsire Triples were rung on handbells.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>February: Stone.</u></i> This was less well attended.
      Before the service the ringing comprised 120 Stedman Doubles, 720 Bob
      Minor, 240 Oxford T.B. Minor and 360 Kent T.B. Minor and other touches.
      There were also courses of Grandsire Triples on handbells. A service and
      uneventful meeting followed.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>March: Mersham.</u></i> This meeting was held joint
      with the KCA Ashford District. Prior to the service the bells were rung to
      Grandsire and Stedman Triples and Bob Major. Mr Alfred Bowell was in
      attendance; he was engaged in that month in the rehanging of the old five
      at Warehorne and recasting the three and four. After the service, meat tea
      at The Farriers Arms and meetings of both companies, Mr Finn took some
      interested persons to his workshops where they had the opportunity to view
      the mini-ring of 10 bells that he had designed.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>April: Woodchurch.</u></i> Unfortunately, this meeting
      had to be cancelled at the last minute due to the Rector being taken ill.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>May: Tenterden.</u></i> Before the service, Grandsire
      and Single Oxford Triples were rung. During the service a peal board
      recording the first single-handed peal of Major on the bells on April 8<sup>th</sup>
      1912 was unveiled. The Leeds Youths accomplished the only other successful
      peal of Major on the bells; Oxford Treble Bob in 1771, but there was a &lsquo;strapper&rsquo;
      on the Tenor. After the tea, a meeting was held.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>June: Woodchurch.</u></i> There were two meetings held
      in June to make up for the missed meeting in April. At Woodchurch 120
      Grandsire, 720 Bob Minor and other touches were rung prior to the Service.
      Tea followed, and at the meeting it was resolved that two peals should be
      attempted, one at New Romney and one at Ashford.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>June: Rye</u></i>. Two weeks later saw the Guild hold a
      joint meeting with the Sussex C.A. Grandsire and Stedman Triples and Plain
      Bob and Kent T.B. Major were rung prior to the service, which was followed
      by tea and the Sussex C.A. meeting.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>July: Aldington.</u></i> This was the Annual Summer
      Meeting. Grandsire and Stedman Doubles and Plain Bob and Kent T.B. Minor
      were rung before the service. Mr Charles Slingsby of the local band kindly
      provided the tea. At the meeting, Mr E.S. Ruck of Mersham (a founder
      member of KCACR) was elected a member.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>August: Annual Outing.</u></i> This took place in the
      Thanet area. The Guild rang at St Peter-in-Thanet first; then at St Johns,
      Margate where they were fortunate enough to be joined by that ingenious
      Gentleman Mr J.N. Oxborrow of the celebrated Surprise Major band at St
      Stephen, Westminster. He assisted by calling some touches at St John&rsquo;s,
      and later the Guild went to St Laurence in Thanet (a ring of eight then).
      The meeting then followed.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>September: New Romney.</u></i> This meeting was held
      joint with the Annual Meeting of the KCA Ashford District. Grandsire and
      Stedman Triples and Plain Bob and Kent T.B. Major were rung before the
      service. Tea and meeting of the KCA Ashford District were held. The
      meeting details were interesting: at that time there were only 4 KCA
      Ashford District meetings a year, and the Rector or Curate at the Church
      visited usually chaired the meetings. If the Clergy were unable to assist,
      then it was usually the District Representative&rsquo;s job to chair the
      meeting (in this instance, Mr George B. Anderson of New Romney held this
      post). Comments were also made at the meeting that the North Kent
      representatives tended to have things too much their own way. Mr Anderson
      responded in the affirmative, and said he sometimes wondered if it was
      worth attending the Committee meetings!</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>October: Iden.</u></i> Unfortunately there was a very
      poor attendance at this meeting, which was hard to account for owing to
      the wonderful sound of the bells. In any event, 720 Bob Minor and some
      Grandsire Doubles were rung prior to the service and meeting.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>November: Rolvenden.</u></i> Grandsire Triples was rung
      prior to the service. Tea and an uneventful meeting followed.</p>


      <i><u>
      </u></i>
      
      <p align="justify"><i><u>December: Stone.</u></i> Details of this meeting
      appeared in the first number of the 1914 Ringing World, which the writer
      has not yet had chance of viewing. At the Rolvenden meeting in November it
      was resolved that a Carol Service should be held at Stone.</p>


      
      
      <p align="justify">The members of the RM &amp; DG hope this has given an
      insight into the present day activities and history of the Guild.</p>
