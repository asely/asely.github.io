      band of ringers at Mersham, but also many villagers.&nbsp; The friendly surroundings and familiar faces
      here extend a warm welcome, allowing news about ringing in the village to
      spread, increasing awareness of the bells among the
      villagers.</p>

      <p>This pub is on the National Inventory of the 17 most historic public
houses in England.&nbsp; Known locally as &ldquo;Doris&rsquo;s&rdquo;
on account of Mrs D. Jemison being owner, ably assisted by her daughter
Kate, and Robert, the music maestro who gives some very good extempore
piano renditions from time to time.&nbsp; This Pub is absolutely magic
&ndash; a safe haven from the lousy times in which we live.&nbsp;
Extremely friendly atmosphere, and loveable boisterous Dalmation dogs
named &lsquo;Sooty&rsquo; &amp; 'Scampi'.&nbsp; Large selection of real ale (you'll NEVER get a bad pint in here!) from the
best Breweries in the country; constantly changing selection including
Milds and Stouts.&nbsp; This place is unbeatable, and the Guild uses it
at every possible opportunity, and members of the Leeds Society of
Handbell Ringers play tunes&nbsp;here at Christmas.<br>

      <p>Along
with the 'Cinque Ports Arms' and 'The Warren' (only
occasionally used by the Guild these days)
these are the only fairly peaceful and real-ale-serving public
houses in New Romney.&nbsp; The Prince of Wales, Fairfield Road is a
very pleasant place with well kept real
ale (usually alternatives to Shepherd Neame!!) frequented by the New Romney ringers after Thursday practices.
&nbsp;Miss R. Dearing, Secretary of the New Romney ringers is the Landlady.<br>

E.A. Greene Esq., former Landlord of the Shepherd &amp; Crook</span>
      
      <p>Formerly owned by Mr Greene, and enjoyed by the Guild since
its re-inception in 1999, this delightful village Inn changed hands in 2004, and is now run by Paul, David and Christine.&nbsp;
There are two or three real ales to choose from, kept very well, and
the pub has become more involved with the local CAMRA campaign
recently.&nbsp; The former public bar has also been turned into a small
restaurant area, and the food is of a very good standard. <br>

      <p>The only good really old-fashioned type local in Hythe
town run by David Ivory, a former Mackeson's Brewery worker.&nbsp; Greene King and Abbot Ale are both
served and kept very well along with real Scrumpy Cider.&nbsp; Friendly pub with a saloon area if you
want a quiet chat.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s even OK on a Friday night!&nbsp; Well
worth a try.<br>

      <h3>Good old fashioned town Public House (Food served at times)</h3>




      
      
      
      
      <p>Friendly local style Inn serving acceptable real ale, usually
including London Pride.&nbsp; It is now the oldest pub in Ashford town
(following
the demolition of &lsquo;The Saracens Head&rsquo; in the 1970&rsquo;s
during the awful vandalism of building the ring-road, which they call
&lsquo;progress&rsquo;).&nbsp; Has recently changed hands, and is
located near to the Guild Secretary's residence, and since being
refurbished it looks very well both inside and out.</p>

      <h1>The Old Prince of Wales, Castle Street, Ashford</h1>
      <h3>Good old fashioned town Public House - No food</h3>
Friendly local style Inn serving Flowers Best Bitter at a very
competitive price. &nbsp;Situated by the Old Tank just off Castle
Street at the corner of what is left of New Street before it was
severed by the ring-road.
      <h1>The British Volunteers, New Street, Ashford</h1>
      <h3>Good old fashioned town Public House - No food (we believe!)</h3>
      <p>This is a tied Shepherd Neame house, but it has a nice
atmosphere and interesting ascent to the bar from the main entrance.
&nbsp;There is also a back bar which seems to be somewhat noisier, but
we found the front bar perfectly acceptable when we visited.</p>
