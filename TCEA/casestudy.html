Study: A Church shewing forth REAL RELIGION.</font></h1><img style="width: 306px; height: 434px;" alt="" src="nutfield2.jpg"><br><h2><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">S.S.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">Sunday
30<sup>th</sup> October 2005 may not stand in the minds of many as
being a particularly significant day &ndash; but significant it was.  For
on this day the Rector of Nutfield, Rev. Graham Ivor Williams retired
from that Parish.  Nothing unusual in that, you might think.  But
Rev. Williams had ministered to his flock for 50 YEARS!  Instituted
on 18<sup>th</sup> October 1955, and retiring on 30<sup>th</sup>
October 2005, the Rev. Gentleman and going in and out amongst his
flock for 50 years, this is a truly remarkable achievement, and the
greatest honour is due to him, not only for serving in a truly Godly
way for this time, but for leaving the finances of the Parish, and
the fabric of the building in such a wonderful state.  If all Church
of England Ministers did as Rev. Williams has done, then the
Established Church would be thriving.  But even Rev. Williams fine
example was subject to criticism from some of the CofE hierarchy in
their typical syncretist bullying way, and the Rev Gentleman has &ldquo;run
the straight race through God&rsquo;s good grace&rdquo;, and all those of us
who worship with the real religion enshrined in the Prayer Book and
39 Articles must thank God heartily for his goodness in presenting
Rev. Williams to the Church of Nutfield, and in allowing him the
health to serve for such a long period.  It is impossible to see how
anyone could serve for such a great period of time under the current
barmy CofE rules, so this is likely to be a record length of service
for a Church of England Minister, at least in the CofE as we now know
it.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif">It is
worth thinking, just briefly, how the world has changed beyond
recognition during Rev. Williams 50 years at Nutfield.  In 1955 all
the current perversions of Society could hardly be imagined, let
alone practised.  The Church of England was still many years away
from the cretinous decision to form Synods, rather than keeping the
Convocations under which the CofE fared much better.  And of course
we can list many of the stupidities that have arisen because of Synod
&ndash; retiring clergy at 70, leaving a huge Clergy Pensions timebomb
which is currently draining the Church of much of its wealth, the
outrageous Synod vote to permit women to become &lsquo;Priests&rsquo; and the
crazy continual vandalism to our liturgy and church buildings in
equal measure (destroying our liturgy and giving us the trash of
Common (Comic) Worship and attempting to rip out perfectly good pews
(as at Ashford, Kent).  Isn&rsquo;t it amazing, dear reader, how they can
all plead poverty until they want to buy a curate a &frac14; million
pound house (as at Ashford, Kent) or spend a fortune on re-ordering a
Church when it suits there agenda of sweeping away our glorious
heritage, without a care for real religion and the doctrines
expressed by the Creeds, Ten Commandments and XXXIX Articles?</font></p>

our regular and Traditionalist ringers, and record our grateful

we might pay our great respects to a truly great man, Rev. Graham
