before any clutter began to appear and when the front pews ran right up to the lectern/pulpit. &nbsp;Dignified &amp; beautiful,
well-equipped for reverent Anglo-Catholic worship</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2 &amp; 3. 2009 - here the church is
looking cluttered. &nbsp;The horrible Nave Altar was added in 1999 on a
temporary licence. &nbsp;The banners are tacky and out of keeping and
the Lectern has disappeared (obscured from view at the right hand side)<br>


The right hand picture also shows the horrible lighting gantry
which has been 'up' constantly for several months now, and just about puts the
'tin lid' on any aesthetic beauty.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Well, this is what those leading
this project want your Parish Church to look like in a couple of years
time. &nbsp;Is this really 'in sympathy' with the building as seems to
be claimed???</span><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">5. This seems to be a flashy diagram from above of the schedule of works as they wish to complete them. </span><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Here is a rather silly
and unconvincing diagram of the three different ways in which it seems to be believed that the
church could be used. &nbsp;We find the idea highly unrealistic.
&nbsp;Some of my colleagues found great amusement in the differences
between church and performance use - "Vestery" (sic) becomes "Green
room" (whatever that may be) for performances, "Congregation" becomes
"Audience", "Sanctuary" becomes "Stage" and &nbsp;"Welcome" becomes
"Foyer"!!!! &nbsp;Of course, the Centrepiece Church in Bank Street
would be another church venue, and that doesn't have any pews; it also
has a stage alreadyt. &nbsp;But no doubt, that hasn't been considered!<br>



      <br>



      </span><big><big>To summarise, it would seem that this project is
being promoted strongly by the Diocese of Canterbury, as changing the
church in this way will relieve the Diocese of some financial
responsibility, and as already stated, they seem to have given up on
the idea of growing a large congregation of good Christians (just as
well some of us still believe that is possible). &nbsp;There have been
few weddings at the church recently; little wonder with all the horrid
clutter in the Nave area. &nbsp;If it looked as in the top picture
taken in the 1970's it would be far more attractive as a Wedding venue.
&nbsp;Help us to preserve this church and put it back to the way it was
in the top picture. &nbsp;Please <span style="font-weight: bold;">act now</span>if
you care, and send an email or letter of objection. &nbsp;Every
objection counts; strength of feeling will win the day. &nbsp;Could you
really bear to see your Parish Church destroyed in the ways proposed -
the last haven of peace in a town which over the last forty years has
been 'raped and pillaged' mainly at the hands of its Borough Council?</big></big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
