Ashford<br>



Borough Council have been pursuing a re-ordering project
for the Church in<br>



the heart of Ashford. Submissions have been made
to the Diocese Advisory<br>



Committee in preparation for the Faculty
Application and this Planning<br>

been taken and the Project Team has<br>



now been encouraged to submit
the Detailed Applications - see attached<br>



minute of the DAC
(Appendix 1). As part of the re-ordering scheme it is<br>



proposed to
put a small extension behind the current vestry, and convert
the<br>



existing organ blower room to provide toilets. As the church
use for<br>



performances increases there is need for rooms where
artists can change<br>



and it is proposed to slightly modify the
furniture in the vestries so they can<br>



double up as "green

cultural centre in the heart of the<br>



town where performances can
take place by visiting artists as well as visual<br>



art exhibitions.
They have identified St Mary's Church as having the potential<br>



to
expand and facilitate these activities within the existing church
with minor<br>



modifications to the building. The Local Authority and
the Church Authorities<br>



have therefore decided to develop St Mary's
as a cultural centre in Ashford.<br>



As the town expands, other venues
may come forward, but for the<br>



foreseeable future St Mary's can
provide a solution to the demand in the<br>



locality with some minor
alterations to the fabric of the Church. These<br>



alterations will
also help facilitate the renewal and restoration of the Church<br>



and
the development of the Church's own work within the

for The Extension<br>



1.4 Attached to this document is a Statement of
the Need from the Church<br>



(Appendix 3) for the whole project as
well as a report from Shea Debnam<br>



Associates produced for Ashford
Council as part of the business plan<br>



detailing the expected
programme for the next two years. Already the Church<br>



is used for a
significant number of concerts which the Council help promote<br>



and
it is hoped that in the early years of the collaboration there will
be at least<br>



five seasons a year of performances (typically up to 3
days) but this could<br>



build up to as much as 15 seasons a year from
national and international<br>



artists. The emphasis will probably be
on musical activities, but it is hoped to<br>



encourage theatrical
performances from small scale touring companies as<br>



well. In
addition to these major seasons, there is a clear local demand
for<br>



large scale events from groups such local choirs, music
groups, schools and<br>



the Ashford Youth Theatre. As well as live
literature events for national and<br>



local poets, writers and
speakers.<br>



At present, performers do change in the vestries rooms
but there are no<br>



toilets and only one small basin, and this is
totally unsatisfactory for the level<br>



of activity that the Church
is expecting to house now and in the future. A<br>



dedicated theatre
would have a series of toilets for artists to use, but given<br>



the
historic nature of the Church and the limited activity, the minimum
we feel<br>



is acceptable in terms of additional toilet accommodation
to serve the vestries<br>



is two toilets.<br>



The studies have shown
the need to accommodate up to 12-14 performers<br>



changing. We
believe that 2 toilets is therefore a minimal provision which<br>



would
be acceptable to visiting companies for the quality of the project
they<br>



are trying to attract. The size of existing vestries is only
just large enough to<br>



accommodate this many people changing and
therefore including the toilets<br>



within the rooms has been
discounted.<br>



We believe the adequate provision of toilets is
important and inadequate<br>



provision would hamper the development of
St Mary's as an attractive venue<br>



for national and international
artists.<br>



The proposed scheme would provide these by converting the
existing organ<br>



blower room into one WC and extending it in small
gap behind it back towards<br>



the north wall of the Chancel to
provide the other toilet. The existing organ<br>



blower would be
lifted up into the roofspace and a new dormer with louvres<br>



provided
to ventilate that space and gain access.<br>



The blower would be
mounted at roof level over the toilets and connect into<br>



the
existing ducts. It would be accessed via a new oak louvered dormer
clad<br>



in lead.</font></font></font></p>

1.5 The only other
option considered was to include these toilets within the
vestry<br>



space but given the need for storage for the existing choir
and clergy, these<br>



two rooms are not overly large. The existing
choir can be up to a dozen or<br>



more in size and the Vicar can be
supported by other clergy and three or four<br>



Servers. Therefore we
have concluded there is not sufficient space within<br>



these rooms to
accommodate the additional toilets.<br>

Significance of the Proposals<br>



1.6 Attached to this document is a
copy of the Architectural History Practice's<br>



Statement of
Significance for St Mary's Church. This details of the<br>



significance
historically and architectural significance of the whole building<br>



has
been considered and it identifies the vestries as one of the latest
parts of<br>



the building. The vestry was built in 1873 and the
architect is unknown.<br>



Originally it would have been a single
storey room but it was divided in 1927<br>



to the designs of Philip
Richard Day. The blower room itself we think was built<br>



around the
same time. The Statement of Significance does identify a fine set<br>



of
cupboards in an old doorway which led out into the space where we
are<br>



proposing to undertake the extension (though there is no
visible doorway on<br>



the outside). These cupboards we feel are of
significance and we have<br>



decided to keep and instead put the
doorway though the middle fireplace area<br>



out into the organ
blower. There is an existing very large nineteenth century<br>



radiator
in the fireplace which would need to be moved. We also feel that
the<br>



insertion of this radiator has already altered the
configuration in this area and<br>



we therefore believe this is the
least significant part of the wall to make a new<br>



opening however
there may be the remnants of a fireplace behind it which will<br>



be
revealed when we open up the area and remove the later cupboards.<br>



1.7
Consultations with the SPAB have suggested that the north wall of
the<br>



Chancel is medieval and should be left exposed so it can
'breathe'. There is<br>



an existing lead downpipe in the corner where
the extension is proposed and<br>



we will need to modify this down

pipe so it comes down onto the new lead flat<br>



roof over the new
extension toilet, and then install a new cast iron downpipe<br>



in the
corner to meet the existing drain run.</font></font></font></p>

together with the<br>

to have been disturbed in the

APPENDIX 3 STATEMENT OF NEED:<br>



      <br>



The re-ordering will offer the opportunity to enhance and
increase<br>



activities, providing an upgraded, well-appointed,
flexible multi-use and<br>



shared space in the body of the nave,
suitable for hosting a wide range<br>



of religious, arts and community
programming<small><small>1</small></small>.<br>



St Mary's has served as a hub for religious,
communal and cultural life in Ashford for<br>



many centuries. The PCC
sees the broader use of the church as being at the heart of<br>



St
Mary's ministry and mission to the town. As Ashford is now
experiencing a period<br>



of growth that will see the town's
population double by 2031, St Mary's location at the<br>



centre of the
original town is a natural place to develop much needed community
and<br>



arts infrastructure for urban Ashford.<br>



A re-ordered St
Mary's will fundamentally serve to better reflect and
accommodate<br>



contemporary forms of worship and to more effectively
support the PCC's towncentre<br>



outreach. The church building in its
current configuration and state of repair<br>



cannot sustain any
further congregation growth at communion and monthly family<br>



services.
It cannot safely and comfortably accommodate larger events such
as<br>



school services, Christingle, baptisms and funerals for 300
people or more. This is a<br>



significant hindrance to the PCC's
mission and ministry and effects the sustainable<br>



future of the
building, to provide streams of income to assist in the conservation
and<br>



enhancement of the Church's historic fabric.<br>



A key growth
priority is to address the current lack of community space and
facilities<br>



for performing and visual arts within the Ashford urban
area. Located at the historic<br>



heart of the town, St Mary's can
play a key role in this cultural transformation of<br>



Ashford by
increasing the longstanding and successful arts use of the church<small><small>2.</small></small>
The<br>



development of an arts programme at St Mary's has been
similarly hampered by<br>



poor lighting, sound, seating, staging and
backstage facilities and the overall<br>



flexibility of the
space.<br>



There is a high degree of convergence between the planned
re-ordering of the<br>



church to meet the needs of local arts and
community groups and the delivery of the<br>



PCC's ministry and
mission, in terms of rehearsing and presenting their work
to<br>



audiences and attenders<small><small>3</small></small>. In particular, to be better able to
present stage/dias-based<br>



activities including liturgical dance,
live music (including lunchtime concerts), poetry<br>



readings, drama
and multimedia presentations to larger seated audiences. The
reordering<br>



supports the need for flexibility to reconfigure the
seating to provide more<br>



intimate settings for reflection,
mediation, talks, prayer meetings, forums, retreats and<br>



exhibitions
of religious art.<br>



The philosophy of a 'shared space' has been
adopted by the PCC and its partners.<br>



Research, consultation and
development work with key stakeholders and potential<br>



arts and
community users indicated that in the first instance, the future
arts<br>



programme
would best operate alongside St Mary's use as a place of worship,
under<br>



three hiring strands which will be discreet but will seek to
be complimentary<small><small>4</small></small>. These<br>



comprise:<br>



1. The Music Programme - a
high quality programme developed and delivered<br>



by an independent
professional music promoter. This offers the opportunity<br>



for
developing a reputation for a new showing space in Ashford and
Kent,<br>



attracting new audiences, developing niche audiences
especially among<br>



young people, and inspiring local performing arts
practitioners.<br>



2. The Arts Development Programme - arts activity

and artist commissions that<br>



involves audience in new experiences
and inspires locally-based artists to try<br>



new approaches to their
work and exhibit in St Mary's. This programme will<br>



be led by The
Arts and Arts Development Sub Committee<small><small>5</small></small> and will support<br>



the need
to celebrate the space, the town, its history and its aspirations.<br>



3.
The Community Programme - offering local artists, arts groups
and<br>



community organisations a well-equipped space for knowledge
sharing,<br>



demonstrations, meetings, training, rehearsal,
presentation and performance,<br>



that provides a focus for the local
community to show and celebrate its<br>



achievements.<br>



This approach
provides a robust mechanism for the PCC to make available St<br>



Mary's
and pro-actively develop with a range of partners and communities
the<br>



use of St Mary's as a quality space for spiritual, artistic
and social activity.<br>



Summary of Re-ordering<br>



Below is a summary
of the reordering proposed and the reasons for the works, within<br>



the
context of the needs described above:<br>



* To provide a flexible
auditorium space in the nave of the church, with improved<br>



sightlines,
increased seating capacity and with the capability of
being<br>



reconfigured to host small and large-scale events.<br>



* To
meet the needs of both contemporary church services and
professional<br>



performances by improving the dias and staging
facilities, including provision of<br>



suitable, high quality
lighting, sound and projection systems.<br>



* To provide a suitable
space for arrival and circulation of audiences and the<br>



church
congregation through reconfiguring the present foyer.<br>



* To provide
toilet, kitchen and bar facilities proportionate with the new
capacity<br>



and functions of the venue, and with the expectations of
paying audiences.<br>



* To provide 'backstage' washing and dressing
room facilities suitable for<br>



professional performers and clergy
alike.<br>



* To provide new flexible office and meeting room spaces.<br>



*
To upgrade the present heating and lighting systems creating a
comfortable and<br>



quality showing space.<br>



This project clearly
delivers the key partners, that is the PCC, Ashford Borough<br>



Council,
Ashford's Future, vision and objectives to raise the profile of
Ashford and<br>



sustain growing needs of the
community.<br>

      <br>




On Saturday&nbsp;4th June 2005, a "wedding" took place at St
Mary-the-Virgin, Ashford.&nbsp; Never before in the history of that
building has such an irreverent, trite, trivial and mawkish noise
rocked its walls.&nbsp; Outside, drum beats hammered from the once holy
and reverent walls.&nbsp; God was irreverenced:&nbsp; this must never
happen again.&nbsp; It appears that those involved with the wedding
actually hail from a non-conformist Church.&nbsp; That organisation
does a lot of good for the local community&nbsp; - very much that which
the PCC at the Parish Church should do.&nbsp; But the style of supposed
'worship' which took place in the walls of the Parish Church last
Saturday is&nbsp; not what should occur in the Church of England.&nbsp;
Our incomparable Book of Common Prayer (1662),&nbsp; the only true book
of instruction and worship in the Church of England, standing the test
of nearly 350 years (and much despised by the majority of modern
'clergy') instructs that marriage is "not by any to be enterprised or
taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly, to satisfy men's carnal
lusts and appetites, like brute beasts that have no understanding, but
reverently discreetly, advisedly, soberly and in the fear of
God".&nbsp; There didn't appear to be any consideration of those facts
by the&nbsp; Bishop of Maidstone, who allowed -indeed welcomed - this wedding.&nbsp;
Nor were the bellringers happy at the late start and length of the

wedding, thus meaning that they wasted an hour waiting in the tower to
ring the bells. <br>




      <br>




I for my part was kicked off the PCC at the recent Annual Meeting of
the Church because I won't toe the modernising line.&nbsp; This gives
me more chance to use my time profitably to further the cause of 'The
Traditional Church of England in Ashford', which is a pressure group
fighting for the restoration of tradition particularly in the Parish
Church, and against the ideas of the modernisers who want to rip out
the pews and destroy the beautiful interior,&nbsp; dumbing the building
down to their puerile level.&nbsp; All those interested in joining the
fight against this should read the Aims &amp; Objectives.<br>




      <br>




No doubt my letter will elicit abusive responses from the modernisers
within the congregation of the Parish Church (one of whom threatened to
smack me in the face for expressing my opinions last Saturday).&nbsp;
But these modernisers have been mismanaging the affairs of your Parish
Church for years (usually blaming the previous Vicar, who, in fact,
worked very hard) - and when it runs out of money and has to close
(which will happen unless the Bishops decide to keep it open and
subsidise it with monies raised by other churches; not an unlikely
prospect) you, dear townspeople, will know who to blame.&nbsp; <br>
