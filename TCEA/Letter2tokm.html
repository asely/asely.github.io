<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">									31<sup>st</sup> January 2006</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">To: The Editor</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">Dear Sir/Madam, 
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">I believe that most of your readers are
probably unaware of what is going on at the lovely old Parish Church
in the town centre at present.  That building and its contents are
part of the heritage of the town, and any major alterations to the
building should be notified to all townspeople.  
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">Since 2003 the church has been under
the control of Revd. Colin Preece who is the Priest-in Charge (not
the Vicar - the parish church finances are so poor that it can&rsquo;t
afford one - though he often styles himself as such).  He appears to
be backed by his Bishop (Bishop of Maidstone, Revd. Graham Cray) in
an agenda of &lsquo;modernising&rsquo; the Church.  So far, this has been
confined to dumbing-down and over complicating the format of the main
Sunday service, as well as embracing the use of a book called Songs
of Fellowship which features trite and meaningless songs and
embarrassing jangling of tambourines and has reduced the once fine
choir to almost non-existence.  However, the next plan is that this
Priest, backed by his Churchwardens and other modernisers is seeking
permission to remove all the pews (which are fine craftsmanship,
installed in 1879 and still in perfectly sound condition) and replace
them with chairs.  Not only this, but the Borough Council have given
&ndash; according to the Ashford Parish Magazine -  &ldquo;A promise of
capital funding totalling &pound;100,000 &hellip;. half in each of the
financial years 2006/7 and 2007/8&rdquo;.  I wonder how many townspeople
are happy with &pound;100,000 of council money being spent on a
project such as this?  Anyone wishing to register objections on
grounds of 1) it being a waste of council money 2) it being a
destruction of our heritage (or any other reasons), then please write
to the Council.  Within the next couple of weeks I shall be placing a
template on our website <font color="#0000ff"><u><a href="http://www.asely.org.uk/">www.asely.org.uk</a></u></font>
which you may fill in and send to the Council for ease if you do not
have time to draft your own letter.  
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">I should point out that Rev. Preece and
his Bishop have sent me letters claiming that they have banned me
from singing in the choir and ringing the bells in the church here,
because I vigorously oppose the modernising agenda.  Did I mention
that Rev. Preece is the Mayor&rsquo;s Chaplain this year?  Anyone in the
town who remembers the great Canon N.M.G. Sharp (Vicar 1955 &ndash; 72)
will well appreciate that he must be turning in his grave about the
aformentioned unsavoury happenings.  If you thought we still lived in
a democracy&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> Yours faithfully</p>
