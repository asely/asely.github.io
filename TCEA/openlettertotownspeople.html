<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">To
all dear friends in the preservation of our heritage,</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">								For
all that you have accomplished so far in the preservation of
tradition, I must thank you most heartily.  We now have a battle so
important that, should we lose, our group will have entirely lost the
fight to preserve tradition in the Parish Church of St Mary-the
&ndash;Virgin, Ashford, and the rich tapestry of heritage as we know it,
and as built up in this town and nurtured since the days of Canon
Alcock (1847) will pass utterly into history.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><u>THE
PEWS.</u></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">Many
of you will know of the plans to remove all the pews from the Nave of
the Church.  Those pews have been part of the church since 1879, when
they replaced a set of Georgian pews (these Georgian Pews remain in
the galleries on the South, West and North walls.)  The pews in the
nave give the church a very special atmosphere.  It is hard to
believe that anyone should want to remove them, but this, I am
afraid, is exactly what the leadership want to do.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><b><u>The
precise situation</u> is as follows:</b></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><b>+</b>
In 1999 the four pews (two on each side) and front rails were removed
from the nave.  I have consulted the Dicocesan Adviser regarding
this.  No Faculty license was obtained for this, but an Archdeacons
Licence was granted.  This is not a permanent license (though there
is no time limit on it) but it was envisaged that the front pews
would sometimes be in the Nave, and sometimes moved away.  No rules
have been broken, but certainly in the time I have been involved
(since 2002) I have not seen the front pews in their correct place &ndash;
they are now left permanently in the South Transept.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><b>+</b>
The reason for moving these pews was to &lsquo;make things cosy&rsquo; (the
leaders would probably choose different words!) so that the choir
would sit right by the congregation at the main 10am service, and the
elements (bread and wine) would be consecrated at the nave altar. 
The modernisers seem to think that this idea will appeal to many.  I
contend that this is not the case &ndash; that the Choir should be in the
Choir stalls, not parading in front of the congregation like a bunch
of animals in a zoo (primarily they should be heard, and I don&rsquo;t
agree that they cannot be heard from the Chancel &ndash; they were heard
between 1879 and 1999 and if they can&rsquo;t be heard now then they
either need to &lsquo;sing up&rsquo; a bit or recruit more souls).  Similarly
the Minister is there to offer prayer and praise to God on behalf of
the congregation, so he should be separated from them and at the High
Altar.  These days there are microphone systems to assist those with
quiet voices, but ideally a Minister should declaim in received
speech so that all may hear and understand.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">If
we retain the pews then this is the sort of church we can expect to
get back to.  A church with its own distinct traditional identity,
not one in competition (and which does a very poor imitation of) the
Baptist Church, the Ashford Christian Fellowship etc.  These Churches
do much good in the Community, and we can be united with them in the
aim of supporting the whole Community, but the way in which the
Orthodox Established Church (that&rsquo;s us!) should be expressing this
is very different from the non-conformist way.  The one way in which
we may not unite, and which I do not believe that God would want us
to unite in, is worship.  Look around the world; God loves diversity.
 We risk losing our identity and our heritage by allowing these pews
to be removed, the knock-on effect of which will be permitting the
building to be used in ways for which it was never intended.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3">What
I am saying (particularly to those vitally important individuals in
the town who do not worship regularly at the Parish Church, but for
whom this Parish Church is still very dearly loved) is: &ldquo;Please
support our cause.  Please help us to preserve this building to the
uses for which it is intended.  Please support the preservation of
our beautiful pews so that future generations may marvel at the real
and timeless beauty of the building (which I&rsquo;m sure you all
appreciate), so that our children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren may see with their own eyes and experience the
awe, majesty and glory of God in reality as expressed by the
traditional Established Church, and not just through a dusty
photograph album&rdquo;.  I offer my personal conviction too that I
personally could build a vibrant church community in the Parish
Church (not that I am likely to be given the chance!) if I were given
charge of the affairs of Ashford Parish Church.  I say this only to
illustrate how sure I am that the traditional way is the right way to
build a strong network of friends of the Church &ndash; both those who
worship, and those in the wider community.  This is precisely what
Canon N.M.G.. Sharp (Vicar 1955 &ndash;72) achieved.  Such successes may
still be found even now: the Parish Church of the small village of 
Nutfield in Surrey (where the Rector has just retired after 50 years
in post) which boasts a strong choir and congregation who will
continue their Rector&rsquo;s good work, also at St Michael Cornhill in
London, where the current Rector brought back traditionalism and his
choir and congregation flourish.</font></font></p>
