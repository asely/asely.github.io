you will find many pictures of the Church in olden time, and will see
from this how we can preserve what is left, and recreate the great
aspects of
the past which drew large congregations, and put Ashford Church truly
at the 'Heart of the community'. &nbsp;Sadly, at present, this
statement could not be further from the truth, with the
syncretist&nbsp;agenda including ripping out the pews and thereby attempting to allow all
sorts of irreverent
practices, services and activities to take place.</h3>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interior
of the Church in the late 19th century. &nbsp;Note that it is all well
pewed and tidy. &nbsp;The Rood screen would not be added until after
the
Great War. &nbsp;Also, a wooden reading desk is present; the present
grand
stone one not yet having been added. &nbsp;Note the Lectern is in the
place it continued to occupy until 2005 when it was sidelined to
the South side of the South-West pillar.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note also that the pews run right up to the Pulpit and Lectern as they should. &nbsp;This arrangement remained until 1999.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">It
is not our policy to permit many colour photographs on this site, but
it was
felt this is one of those which should be included. &nbsp;This is the
interior
of the Church in the late 1970's. &nbsp;In 1985 toilet and meeting room
facilities were added at the back of the Church. &nbsp;There can be
little objection to that.
&nbsp;However, the wisdom of removing the font from under the West
Gallery to its current position near the South West pillar of the
Chancel front is very
questionable.&nbsp;<br>





      <br>

It is worth noting that there have been a number of
occasions on which the church has suffered removal of pews.
&nbsp;Firstly in June 1958 came the removal of pews (by Faculty) from the
North Transept (out of view on the left of the above picture).
&nbsp;These pews were supposed to be retained in the Church or Church
Hall according to the wording of the faculty, but I can find none of
those in existence today. &nbsp;Then in October 1969 a Faculty was
applied for to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;all the pews from the Strangford-Smyth
Chapel (to the right of the
picture). &nbsp;Chairs replaced these pews and the Chapel was
rededicated as the Chapel of St Francis, to the memory of the late
Harry Knock. &nbsp;In 1985 when the West-End of the church was
reordered, some pews were removed from there and disposed of. &nbsp;Then</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> in 1999</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">the&nbsp;pews
and runners at the front of the Nave
on each side were removed on a Temporary Licence granted by the
Archdeacon at the time. &nbsp;It appears that this Licence only covered
a two-year period, but it is now ten years since that work was
undertaken.&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
removal of the front pews and front runners
on each side, which now allows for a hideous nave altar (the Altar
which was formerly in the St Francis Chapel) to be used is abhorrent.
&nbsp;We wish for the Temporary (since 1999!) Licence to be revoked
especially as it seems to have run well past its intended date,
&nbsp;the Nave altar removed, and the
front pews and runners replaced.<br>





      </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; It must be stressed that the removal of pews from the front of the Nave has resulted in a
very odd and messy look, and paved the ways for liberalism in the
liturgy. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>As long as the good fight is won to keep all the existing pews in the Nave, and replace the
front ones which have currently been moved (ONE OF WHICH H.M. QUEEN
ELIZABETH II OCCUPIED DURING THE '500TH ANNIVERSARY SERVICE OF THE
DEDICATION OF THE CHURCH' IN 1970) to the Strangford-Smythe Chapel on temporary
Licence.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>

modernisers is not prevented the jewl in Ashford's crown will be lost
