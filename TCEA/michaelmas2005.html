My dear people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
Following a wonderful summer season, we once again find ourselves back
struggling against the dark elements within our beloved church.<br>
<br>
In late August, I attended Evensong here at St Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This
was led by the new Curate, who began the service late.&nbsp; The
fluency was at best lacking, as the service wound along its weary way,
and then I was publicly admonished for simply pointing out that there
is only one Office Hymn &ndash; the second LESSON (NOT Reading!) is
followed immediately by the Nunc Dimittis, not another Hymn.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure that the fellow is on a learning curve, but frankly it
is scandalous that anyone is being ordained without a fluent and
intimate grasp of the doctrine and language of our incomparable 1662
Book of Common Prayer.&nbsp; No doubt the Curate had also been briefed
about what a troublemaker I am (because I fight the modernising lunacy
&ndash; but trying to have a stand-up row with one of the congregation
for gently advising the correct procedure at Evensong is just
despicable.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the world on its head, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; The one who defends our religion most staunchly is despised
and pilloried.&nbsp; Not just me, but all staunch
Traditionalists.&nbsp; We are not allowed a view, so say the
totalitarian liberal elite.&nbsp; Out and out Evangelicals who are
prepared to go 50/50 with either all out services of Praise &amp;
Worship we can contend with.&nbsp; They give us our BCP
&ndash;unadulterated &ndash; and then they do their stuff
separately.&nbsp; They want to help; they want to find a solution to
problems.&nbsp; The bullies around here only seek to drive us
out.&nbsp; We aren&rsquo;t getting the true BCP &ndash; what we are
getting is services which are doctored according to the whim of whoever
happens to be &lsquo;leading&rsquo; them.&nbsp; That means that the all
important Ten Commandments are omitted from the 8am Holy Communion
(1662), and the ridiculous political correctness of inserting
&ldquo;mankind&rdquo;, &ldquo;humankind&rdquo;, &ldquo;all
people&rdquo; or some other crass idiocy instead of just understanding
that &ldquo;all men&rdquo; encompasses both sexes.&nbsp; It always did,
and it always will.&nbsp; Likewise we have to use the readings for the
Vth Form remove at Evensong, rather than the proper Authorised Version
(this tinkering is very common these days) and extempore prayers which
are so ghastly and trite that words just defeat me at this point!&nbsp;
If only this generation of Clergy would understand the basics of
masculine and feminine in Latin, but then we don&rsquo;t have many
Clergy now with MA (Cantab) or MA (Oxon) after their name and it shows
in the sort of mind-numbing trash which they force us to endure, and
pass off as worship!<br>
<br>
I feel that we really are at the lowest ebb ever though, when people
are playing political games in the middle of a service, and abusing the
power conveyed upon them by Bishops to silence those who are of a right
conversation.&nbsp; Could Canon Sharp ever have possibly imagined that
33 years after his retirement this level of un-Christian bullying might
prevail?&nbsp; This is often a question which I ponder in my mind; not
just with regard to St Mary - the &ndash; Virgin, Ashford but at St
Nicholas Leeds - the wife of the last BCP-adhering Vicar there
confirmed to me that her husband would have been absolutely appalled at
the abuse that the current Priest in Charge there, Professor Robin Gill
(a modern Theologist &ndash; there&rsquo;s a contradiction! &ndash; at
University of Kent) continues to level at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would not
have happened when John was Vicar&rdquo;, Canon John Robinson&rsquo;s
wife assured me just a few months ago. <br>
<br>
So much for the &ldquo;no support for my views&rdquo; which people of
the ilk of Colin Preece or Robin Gill vitriolically assure me.&nbsp;
Both have told me in no uncertain terms to &ldquo;get out&rdquo; of
their respective Parishes.&nbsp; Their Parish?&nbsp; I wonder what God
thinks of that statement.&nbsp; Neither of these two individuals (nor
many others it would appear) have ever studied the BCP Ordination
service.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a question which the Bishop is supposed to
ask of each potential Priest at the Ordination service: (Direct Quote
from 1662 BCP) &ldquo;Will you reverently obey your Ordinary and other
chief Ministers, unto whom is committed the charge and government over
you; following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions, and<br>
&nbsp;*For the avoidance of doubt the word &lsquo;man&rsquo; here
includes all people, as does every reference of its kind in the 1662
BCP.<br>
submitting yourselves to their godly judgements?&rdquo;&nbsp; I think
Messrs Gill, Preece and our new Curate might have a problem with the
response &ldquo;I will so do, the Lord being my helper&rdquo; to this
question!&nbsp; Modern Clergy need to &lsquo;get real&rsquo; and work
out that they are NOT &lsquo;the boss&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a step
down being a Minister, NOT a step up!&nbsp; Until they do they will
only attract spineless fellow travellers on the crusade to bully every
traditionalist into outer darkness.&nbsp; They might think that&rsquo;s
a great idea, but the spineless are only seen in the fair
weather.&nbsp; They will soon &lsquo;bail out&rsquo; when the money
dries up &ndash; and that will happen to the whole Church of England in
just a few years &ndash; its outdated spendthrift ways are
unsustainable.<br>
<br>
Our website will be up and running soon, and I do exhort all of you
with computer access to view it.&nbsp; Copies of this letter may be
printed from it, and distributed.&nbsp; However, I will always ensure
that all those of you without this &lsquo;new-fangled&rsquo; equipment
are provided with copies!<br>
<br>
Once again many thanks to you all for your continuing support in these
dark days.&nbsp; There are a great many perils and dangers still facing
us who defend and campaign for real religion, but surely we can face
these in sure confidence that the Prayer Book is our shield &ndash; our
knowledge is our greatest weapon against complacency, and against the
modern liturgy of Common Worship which teaches nothing, and thus causes
ignorance of the disciplines and tenets of our faith as revealed in the
Creeds, Ten Commandments and 39 Articles of Religion to grow.
