<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Ashford Parish Church Archive&nbsp;</h1>



During the time of Canon Everett's Freehold, great efforts were made
by the late Messrs Cormack and Hall (the former Church Archivist) along
with Mr J. Moon and Canon Everett, both with regard to cataloguing all
the Archives, but more specifically the desire to retain the Church
Archives in the Church building, in accordance with the procedures
requested by the County Archivist. &nbsp;As some items had been stored
for hundreds of years in the Parish Church, it was felt it would be sad
to see them go. &nbsp;When Mr Hall became terminally ill, he asked Mr
C.J. Cooper if he would be prepared to take over the care of the
archives. &nbsp;Mr Cooper ensured this was ratified by a PCC meeting.
&nbsp;However, the PiC who had since joined the church, and one of his
Churchwardens had ideas to move the archives to Maidstone. &nbsp;They,
however, also thought it perfectly acceptable to arrange the transfer
without informing the Archivist (Mr Cooper), no doubt knowing that Mr
Cooper and a number of other Parishioners would have been unhappy to se
their transfer. &nbsp;Upon enquiring with the Maidstone Archive, it
became clear that they only wanted written documents of over 100 years
in age. &nbsp;They had also been told by the church hierarchy that
'no-one isi interested in the archive' and that there was no longer an
archivist, even though Mr Cooper had been ratified as such at a PCC
meeting.&nbsp; &nbsp;This now brings us to the present situation, which
is that, whilst the important handwritten archives have&nbsp;
been transferred to the County Archive in Maidstone,&nbsp; they did not
want many of the following
items (not an exhaustive list, but from memory that which was formerly
in the room at the West end of the church, and known as the Warden's
Vestry). &nbsp;These items MAY still be in there which would be
perfectly acceptable and to be desired, but we are not completely sure,
and hope to view these items in detail in the near future. &nbsp;We are
of course concerned; these items are, after all
irreplaceable, and as far the social history of Ashford (especially the
Church and its organisations) in the last 100 years or so is concerned,
they are an extremely interesting and valuable resource, and should be
generally available at least for viewing, and preferably also at least
a precise list, if not also copies, should be available on the
internet; a task which Mr C.J. Cooper had intended to complete had the
unfortunate happenings documented elsewhere on this part of the site,
not occurred . &nbsp;Below is the list of items we are concerned for:<br>





<br>





+ Old Parish Magazines dating back as far&nbsp; the 1880's (many years
bound into volumes until the 1970's) and mainly complete through to at
least 2004<br>





+ Many old service books used at the Parish Church before the advent of
liturgical revision (BCP's, Lectern KJV Bibles, Hymns A&amp;M Revised
etc.) as well as books collected together by Mr Cooper, which
he&nbsp;had discovered dumped in the North gallery. &nbsp;Many of these
were "Children's Church" books.<br>





+ Other books retrieved from the collection in the former church
library which was at the West end of the church. &nbsp;The books
retrieved contained front plates recording that they were given as
prizes or for confirmation to children of Ashford Parish Church, and
were signed by Canon Tindall (Vicar until 1914)<br>





+ In the Churchwarden's strongboxes were several very old &nbsp;and
large BCP copies specifically relating to, and for the use of Ashford
Parish Church, as well as at least one Book of Homilies, also of a very
ancient date.<br>





+ There were also a number of more recent (within the last 30 years)
photographs and articles regarding Ashford Parish Church which were, in
the main, put into two albums by Mr C.J. Cooper during his time as
Archivist.<br>





+ Numerous faculty request/confirmation documents relating to various
works on the church, including removal of pews at various times, a 1927
faculty regarding the building of the upper stage of the current choir
Vestry, and the purchase and faculties for installation of the metal
riddle-posts and curtains for the two east-end &nbsp;side altars
(which, vitally, were mentioned at a PCC meeting when an attempt was
made to have the posts and curtains removed and the altars moved
forward : the fact that the faculty was extant saw-off attempts to have
them removed<br>





+ Official Agreements between Vicars and Organists/Choirmasters regarding the tenure and conditions of the latter.<br>





+ Official Documents signed by Vicars following their "reading
themselves in" by swearing Assent to the XXXIX &nbsp;Articles of
Religion.<br>





+ Several colour copies of old pictures of&nbsp;Parish Clergy and
activities which Mr C.J. Cooper during his time as Archivist had
started to put into frames purchased at his own cost.<br>





+ A tall metal cupboard (not shown in pictures) containing various
interesting maps and plans relating to Ashford Parish Church, Christ
Church South Ashford, and the details of the sale of the old Mission
Church in Forge Lane which is now used by the Scouts. <br>





+ A tin trunk containing various interesting items of paperwork
including receipts and items of work carried out on the Parish Church
and The College.<br>





+ Two smaller metal cupboards (bought specifically in the 1990's for
the acceptable storage of archive material in the room) one containing
many 'Register of Services' and Parish Rate books going back to the
1700's, and the other containing many black binders in which were filed
lots of loose sheets of all sorts of interesting information, and each
item painstakingly catalogued. &nbsp;This work was accomplished by the
late Messrs Cormack, Hall and Mr J. Moon and Canon J.W. Everett. <br>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">	I wish to bring to the attention of
your readers some most unfortunate incidents, which show just how low
certain Priests are prepared to stoop to rain down their own personal
abuses on those who refuse to tow the modernising line.  In the space
of two years I have had my property (large bits of furniture!) from
one belfry removed and dumped outside my front door, at another
church because I oppose plans to rip out all the pews, the Priest is
attempting to ban me from singing in the choir there and ringing the
bells (by a crazy interpretation of Canon F8!), even enlisting the
support of his Bishop, but finally another clergyman has put the
&lsquo;icing on the cake&rsquo; by inconveniencing 8 other bellringers who
had travelled a considerable distance by his refusal to ring in a 3
hour peal attempt (just before it was due to start) which he had
previously agreed to, because he discovered that I was ringing, and
presumably felt that he must display some sort of solidarity towards
his &lsquo;moderniser&rsquo; friends.  My question is: Where will this all
end?  It&rsquo;s no wonder that the Church of England can&rsquo;t get people
into the pews when certain Ministers treat full members like me in
such a contemptible way for upholding tradition with the utmost
vigour.  The reason the Church of England is in such a mess is that
it has failed to appreciate, teach and use The Book of Common Prayer,
Hymns A&amp;M (Standard) Choral Music of a sufficient standard and to
insist that all Ministers are taught the worth of BCP doctrine and
liturgy and the 39 Articles before they are ordained, and that they
fully assent to both.  I am 27 years old.  It&rsquo;s time that those
clergy nearing retirement moved over from the limelight with all
their outdated 1960&rsquo;s liberalism,and let the younger generation try
to pick up the pieces left from the damage that their liberal
theology and disuse of the Prayer Book and refusal to be &lsquo;read in&rsquo;
to their Parish has done.</p>
