it the case that, in Mediaeval times - in fact often until the
Victorian era - the Nave of a church was used for Parish Activities,
markets etc? &nbsp;So what's the problem?</font></font></h1>



      <big><font color="#ffffff"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><big><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><big><big>Indeed,
churches were often used in such a way. &nbsp;A rood screen or altar
rail was there in some cases to keep animals away from the altar if a
cattle market were held in the church! &nbsp;Those primitive mediaeval
folk thought that all this was perfectly acceptable so long as the
screen or rail kept the Sanctuary from profanement. &nbsp;I hope we
have come a long way since those days! &nbsp;The above
question has no substance, and is a favourite ploy amongst some members
of the Church of England to justify tearing out pews - it suits their
agenda when they have given up on the use of a church as a church!
&nbsp;This pew removal was
done at Ivychurch, to name just one church of many, and Barn Dances
have been held in the Church since.
&nbsp;Yes, in the Church - I ask you?! &nbsp;Such dancing might well
have been held as fine to be held in a church by mediaeval persons, but
do we really think that is acceptable in the 21st Century when there is
so much debauchery in the world? &nbsp;Let's keep God's houses of
prayer as the special sanctuaries of peace which we need in this mad
world today. &nbsp;<br>


Basically, there is no
substance in the assertion that it is acceptable to use any part of a
church
building (obviously this excludes the belfry, vestry or kitchen
facilities!) for anything other than either worship or activities which
are
within the Canon Law of the Church of England - held to be those things
which do not profane the &nbsp;sacred building. &nbsp;But Canon Law
(this is what church law is known as) is only as good as those
upholding it, so it is the
responsibility of diligent people of the Parish to report
activities&nbsp;which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> profane the building </big></big></font></font></big></font></font></font></big><big><font color="#ffffff"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><big><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><big><big>to their Diocesan Bishop</big></big></font></font></big></font></font></font></big><big><font color="#ffffff"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><big><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><big><big>
and then to keep on pressing the matter
with said Bishop! &nbsp;Bishops would often rather turn a blind eye and
let these things happen because they know that the Church of England
(through its own fault, we would add) is short of money, and every
parish or benefice of the Church of England has to pay a huge amount
(called a quota) each year to the central Church of England fund - the
amount runs into many tens of thousands of pounds for a church such as
Ashford - so if an activity is a way of making money they will often
let it happen if no-one objects. &nbsp;But we should be above such
monetary considerations: first and foremost we are Christian Church and
should be setting an example to the secular world - shifting about
allowing wrongful activities in church to raise some cash is
disgraceful.
&nbsp;Let us remember what Jesus himself said "My Father said 'My House
shall be a house of prayer' but ye have made it a den of thieves".
&nbsp;Now, we're not saying that those who attend such events are
thieves (!), but Scripture is not always to be taken in an absolutely
literal sense.
&nbsp;What Jesus was saying is that his Father's (i.e. God's) House
should not be used for trivial and secular activities which profane it
(i.e. cheapen the place which is God's House through the questionable
nature of activities) but that it should be a house of
Prayer - ie somewhere that anyparishioner can visit, especially in time
of need, either for private
prayer or for public prayer (i.e. services; worship). &nbsp;That is
what all the building is meant for, and it has, through all time, been
equipped as a church. &nbsp;We actually have no firm record that
markets or the like were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ever</span>
held in Ashford church, and it has been
pewed since 1745. &nbsp;A final word on the original question; as I
say, one
along with many others used to justify doing something (also such as
shaking
hands and saying 'peace' to each other halfway through a service;)
because it is a 'return to the early church'. &nbsp;Well, we used to go
bear-baiting in mediaeval times: I wonder if you suggested that we
should return to that practice - perhaps even hold a session in church!
- what all these people who want to return our churches to being used
for similarly unseemly practices of screaming, dancing and jumping
about (but somehow acceptable to the current
aelite ruling classes at their own whim which they don't think they
need to justify) would think of that? &nbsp;When you think about
what these people have to say for themselves, it's not hard to shoot
their argument
down! </big></big></font></font></big></font></font></font></big>

is of course quite true, the church has undergone many alterations
during its history, but we need to look at why alterations took
place and whether the reasons for them were sound. &nbsp;The church was
first pewed in 1745. &nbsp;The galleries
which we now must keep (because they are something of a rarity) were a
necessity in early days because the church had to accommodate so many
people! &nbsp;<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pews in the South Gallery -

      </span><big><font color="#ffffff"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><big><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><big><big>A hundred years ago the people of Ashford would have
dearly liked to be rid of the galleries, but they had to stay because
there was a need for all the seating! &nbsp;Now we have been ordered to
keep the galleries and all the pews therein by organisations such as
English Heritage because those pews date
back to the 18th Century and it is also supposed that some of them may
once
have been the pews from the Nave. &nbsp;No matter that the current pews
in the Nave are of much better quality, being as they are of oak, the
heritage organisations rank the plain pine pews as more worthy!
&nbsp;But why did alterations take place to this church over the
centuries, and were they all for the good? &nbsp;Well, the Nave was
extended to the West by one bay in 1861 to accommodate the growing
number of townspeople. &nbsp;The numbers of townspeople were of course
increasing not least because of the coming of the railway.
&nbsp;Earlier still, the North &amp; South walls of the Nave had had to
be taken down and rebuilt to extend the width of the building again in
an attempt to improve seating capacity. &nbsp;In those days the pews
were mostly rented by families and histories of the church tell us that
the pews were not of a good sort and cluttered the building very badly.
&nbsp;None of these foregoing alterations however, were done as a
gimmick or an experiment
on a whim, but because the prevailing conditions at the time
necessitated increasing the space - and that was a fact. &nbsp;The
plans we are presented with now are based only on what might happen.
&nbsp;There are no certainties that the propsed alterations would bring
any real benefit to most of the Community. &nbsp;All that the current
plans
prove to anybody is that some of the people at Ashford Parish Church
have given up on trying to make this church viable as a church with a
large and
happy congregation and instead want to turn it over to secular uses,
some of the congregation having in fact by their past actions been
responsible for causing schism within the congregation; they now expect
to be rewarded with a scheme that completes what they perceive as
utopia
(some of which will be inappropriate in God's House). &nbsp;We might
also ask why the pulpit, lectern and altar reredos are Victorian?
&nbsp;Well, the Victorians, fallible though they were in many ways
believed that an important ex-Collegiate church such as Ashford should
be equipped with the most lavish and beautiful items, and wealthy
townspeople, following the Commandments of God as they did "If ye have
much, ye are to give much" did indeed do that. &nbsp;The layout of the
church as it stands makes it very clear that the lay-people
(parishioners) are to sit in the Nave and the Ministers &amp; Choir
(the Choir are a representation of what began as "Vicars Choral") are
to occupy the choir stalls in the Chancel. &nbsp;In recent years there
has been a backlash against this - it smacks of 'class' you see, and
there is a certain type of person today simply obsessed with
old-fashioned class-war. &nbsp;Do not doubt that the recent ideas which
have unfortunately reared their very ugly heads in many lovely old
churches: with choir, clergy and
congregation all being squashed together in one indistinct lump are a
misguided attempt at symbolising
equality. &nbsp;The rather ironic thing is that an awful lot of Church
officials
today are far more domineering than previous generations ever were, but
as with so much of the world today, it is all about what it LOOKS like
- all spin and no substance.<br>









I will touch finally in this section however on a most unseemly time
for our dear Parish Church, and there are certainly a few similarities
which can be drawn between that time and the plans we are now faced
with. &nbsp;As many will know, the 17th century was a very unsettled
time in Church &amp; State, and at Ashford, the primitive
Non-conformists intruded into the church under their Pastor, Joseph
Boden in 1643, ejecting the rightful Vicar, John Maccuby. &nbsp;Boden
and his people caused much damage to the Church and College with their
vile puritanical nonsense, removing or altering many items which had
been part of the inherited property and faith of the Church for
hundreds of years. &nbsp;Their greatest act of vandalism and heresy
occurred in 1644 during the Civil War. &nbsp;I shall here quote from
the preamble to the list of subscribers who paid for a new and decent
altar piece to be set up; Boden's lackeys having hacked the old one
down: <big>"Whereas
the ancient Altar and Altar-piece of the Parish Church of Ashford,
having been both decent &amp; ornamental, rising with a fine ascent and
the same railed in after a decent manner, were in the time of
rebellion, in the reign of our truly pious and martyred sovereign, King
Charles the First, of blessed memory, in the year of our Lord 1644
sacrilegiously defaced and removed, the Altar razed even unto the
ground and some of the materials converted to their own private uses by
men as well of factious and rebellious principles and practices as
sacrilegious; and to perpetuate this their infamous act and
sacrilegious depredations, the then Churchwardens, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Joy Starr</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">William Worsley</span>
two of the actors in so great and villainous a profanation and profuse
wasters of the church's treasure, had their names cut in stone which
they placed in the wall where the ancient Altar-piece stood, as a
monument thereof, but is now taken out and broken to pieces, it being a
shame to our church that the names of such men should remain there,
already too long, who under the hypocritical mask and disguise of
abhorring idolatry, dared to be guilt of so bold a sacrilege as to
violate God's altar." </big>&nbsp;Right, well now, in 2009 we are not
talking about the destruction of the High Altar, but the removal of a
very fine set of pews which generations have sat in and faithfully
worshipped the good God as well as other alterations which rather than
adding to the building as has usually been in the past constitute major
alterations of a kind that would render the church a very different
place than it is today. &nbsp;If the pews were to be removed it is
entirely probable that profane practices would be allowed to take place
in the building, and surely a few generations hence an altogether more
righteous and sober generation would lament the damage and loss of
heritage in similar terms as those used by the writer of the above
preamble, round condemning Starr &amp; Worsley in the strongest
possible terms. &nbsp;
Not satsified with the wrecking of the Ancient Altar, on Christmas Day
1644 Boden went on to have the Fogge
Coats of Arms taken down out of the College windows and disposed of -
these were in stained glass. &nbsp;It should be remembered here that it
was Fogge
who had the church rebuilt and endowed in the mid 15th century: what
sheer folly of arrogance to take down the Arms of the man who wrought
such noble work? &nbsp;And why, today should we dispose of pews
purchased in the time of Canon Alcock, who brought Ashford Church from
a state of virtual disuse when he began his Ministry in 1847 to the
great success it was &nbsp;by the time of his retirement in 1887.
&nbsp;Returning to the 18th Century, Maccuby's sucessor Nicholas Prigg
who took the
Pastorship (if one might call it that - vertainly these two villains
were not Vicars!) of the Church on in 1647 was no
doubt of the same stamp as his predecessor, but happily was ejected in
the year 1662, in which year the Book of Common Prayer as revised in
that year was brought into use in all churches across the land and
continued in virtually all Church of England churches as the one and
only true recognised formulary and service book until the 1960's when
trendy ideas began to catch hold. &nbsp;Happily most of these ideas are
finally losing favour as they have failed to increase congregation
numbers and in fact have usually had the opposite effect - driving
faithful people away from their Parish Churches. &nbsp;This is why
there are so many people who consider themselves to be Christian but do
not think it is worth going to church - and sadly they are right!
&nbsp;It is this background that we have to work against and show
people that the church will give them a spiritual dimension in their
lives which they otherwise would not have. <br>

With this kind of mentality, it's no wonder that some people involved
with the church think that the crazy proposals they are now bringing
forward are good ones and that they are somehow &lsquo;in sympathy&rsquo;
with the building, which they clearly are not!  As one of the
proposals is to move the pulpit to where the Lectern currently is,
where will the Lectern be put then?  It isn't featured or mentioned
in any of the future plans that I have seen. It will be retained of
course, only because it will have to be, but it belongs where it was
until 2004 and seeing this replaced is yet another facet of our campaign.</big></big></font></font></big></font></font></font></big></p>

is nothing at once particularly objectionable in proposals for the new
ground-source
heating plans as long as it will not result in any irreparable damage
to the pew platforms, floor or any other furnishings, or require very
much intrusive boring in the churchyard (which after all is still a
sacred burial ground, even if closed), but the old pipes and, indeed,
heating system should be retained even if a newer system is
installed. These massive old pipes really add to the character of
the church, running round the pew platforms as they do, and are just
as worthy of preservation as any other part of the fabric of the
building. The boiler which runs this system is obviously very old
&ndash;
I don&rsquo;t know the exact age but&nbsp; would guess Victorian - the
pipes which run all around the pew platforms certainly are and we want
all these pipes preserved in their current position.
Today,
people pay a fortune for these old systems, with pipes and all, and I
cannot think of another church which ever had a system quite like the
Ashford one; and certainly none which has been retained as with ours;
this must make it a rarity and thus worthy of preservation - in the
same vein as preserving the galleries on grounds of rarity. Painting
the set of pipes at the rear of the church with white paint (on the
west wall)
was a mistake; these should be stripped of the paint and then repainted
in black; or in fact all the pipes could be stripped down and
polished up with black grate polish if that was how they originally
were.</big></big></font></font></font></big></big></p>

      <font color="#ffffff"><font face="Book Antiqua, serif"><font size="3"><big><big>The
North Transept until 1927 was used as the Vicar&rsquo;s vestry, with
the
choir robing in the current downstairs vestry. Then in 1927, an
upper floor was added to the choir vestry and this now forms the
Clergy vestry. I have not yet been made aware of the exact plans for
what they call &lsquo;renovation&rsquo; of the Vestry, but one can bet
that
it would be just about as unsympathetic as the rest of the plans for
the church. If this is the case, any plans for reordering of the Vestry
will also be
opposed. Removing the cupboards and cassock hanging spaces in the
Lower Vestry would be acceptable as they are of no great age and
fairly poor quality, but having done that, replacement with cupboards
and hanging areas in high quality timber (preferably dark oak) of grand
Victorian period design to complement the rest of the lower Vestry
would be most appropriate. The wall clock in the Vestry should be
serviced by a competent horologist and the beautiful framed testimony
given to Dr Wilkes, first Choirmaster &amp; Precentor and which hangs
high on the Vestry wall very much out of sight should be taken down and
cleaned before being placed on the Vestry wall in a much
more prominent position, preferably along with a picture of Dr Wilks.
There is some clutter in the North East
corner of the Vestry which should be searched through and anything of
possible interest retained as also with the drawers of the central
vestry
table. It is important to note that in all probability there are small
fragments of wood which have at one time or another been broken off
items such as the fine carved rood screen&hellip; these should be
retained and refixed
by a competent workman. A plan by our former Vicar, Canon Everett
was to hang a number of large pictures which are currently in the
Warden&rsquo;s Vestry&nbsp; - and are old paintings and
drawings of the church &ndash; from the wall of the Lower Vestry as it
ascends the flight of
stairs, and it would be most pleasing finally to bring this plan to
fruition. The pictures were cleaned and restored by the late Mr Tom
Hall a few
years ago. The Upper Vestry, notwithstanding its comparatively
recent age is a most quaint and interesting room. Clearly,
especially at the upper level the window from the church into the
Vestry spaces is filthy and needs thoroughly cleaning and possibly
repairing, which might require removal. As for the remainder of the
upper vestry space it seems quite adequate for a staff of one Vicar and
several curates, and with the College (Vicarage) being so close to
the church, it can hardly be thought that any further facilities in
this Upper Vestry would be required other than what is already there.
Again, in both cases of Upper &amp; Lower Vestries, we would be
suspicious that the whole
practice would be of change for the sake of it. The choir and clergy
are
left wanting for nothing of any reasonable nature as the Vestries
currently stand. We are open to useful new and good ideas,
but cannot think of any at present, so would recommend simply a good
restoration of that currently existing, and a tidying of the space
behind the organ pipes. It would be worth investigating the
possibility of using that space (and if possible space under the
organ pipes if there is any) for the storage of folding staging of
the type which is used in Hythe Parish Church for concert staging. </big></big></font></font></font>

aforementioned staging can then be wheeled very simply from the short
distance comprising the area behind the organ pipes in the North
Transept into place under the tower for any seemly concerts which
might be scheduled to take place, with the stage being built and removed
&lsquo;on
the night&rsquo; under the tower space; any lighting required could
also
be rigged up under the tower space quite easily, (the proposed design
for the gantry which they wish to permanently install from the nave
ceiling looks as though it could instead be fitted and then removed
&lsquo;on the night&rsquo; just below the ceiling of the tower space as
access can be easily had from the ringing room - the room from which
the church bells are rung). It would be perfectly simple to set a
gantry as required on the floor under the tower and then someone
could draw the gantry up using appropriate equipment to the required
level when setting up for the concert, afterward lowering it in the same
manner. &nbsp;Pictures exist from the 1950's of perfectly
acceptable staging arrangements for nativity plays held under the tower space, and
the effect was very acceptable, so it has already been tried and works<br>

here are less controversial purely because this area was re-ordered in
about 1985.  However, one needs to ask whether the works now proposed
are really that necessary.  Hard by the church, at the East End we
have a perfectly good church hall, often underused, with perfectly
useful toilet facilities.  Why would we duplicate this at the back of
the church by installing lots of toilets?  One improved toilet,
updated, is understandable, but more than that?  Unless of course the
plan is to sell off the church hall, which wouldn&rsquo;t be beyond the
realm of possibility!  Such a plan if there were one should be
roundly condemned and is merely a symptom of the way in which the
Church of England central body will grab any money it can from
parishes to try and prop up its flagging finances, a situation quite
of its own making having invested badly on stocks and shares, and
having flooded our Parish churches with ridiculous innovations which
have made congregation members vote with their feet and stop
attending church.  With regard to the Crothall Room, where coffee is
taken on many a Saturday morning amongst its other uses: again,
improvements of one or another nature could be acceptable, but the
serving hatch idea (to serve drinks to people from the room directly
into the church) is to be deprecated in the strongest possible terms.
 Whilst a few souls may, on a Saturday or Sunday, take their tea or
coffee in church, the idea of serving it from the Crothall Room into
the church sends out entirely the wrong message.  It could well lead
to people having drinks during services rather than just after and we
need to make very clear dividing lines between what is the small
&lsquo;social&rsquo; area at the rear of the church and the main body of the
church which is God&rsquo;s house and not a free-for-all.  Any idea to
serve copious amounts of alcohol at concerts will not only fly in the
face of Christian teaching on the subject of drunken-ness, but would
only serve to increase the rowdy and drunken behaviour which Church
Yard residents currently have to endure and which a few members of
the council have gone to great lengths to try and curb.</big></big></font></font></font></big></big></p>

night in the same way that the memorial garden gates are.  A code
lock (with code changed on a fairly regular basis) known only to
those who may require evening access to the church would be most
suitable.  Especially with the amount of night-time activity around
the churchyard, and particularly on Friday and Saturday nights it is

protected by the placing over them of a fine metal gridwork to
protect from stones or other objects being thrown.  At a Church

which plays a short tune each day at 9am, Noon, 3pm, 6pm &amp; 9pm. The
tune is a different one each day, with a Hymn playing on Sunday
and there are two separate barrels (upon which the tunes are scored
out) allowing for two different selections of tunes over a two week
period if the barrels are swapped each week. This is a wonderful
novelty piece and indeed, once the tower is quite clear it would be
possible to open it to the public at weekends; such a scheme of tower
opening exists at Rye church, and they report that tens of
thousands of pounds are raised each year for their church just from
opening the tower and charging each visitor a small fee to ascend. What
a splendid way this would
be to help keep our church solvent and at the same time show what a
noble history our church tower has! </big></big></font></font></big></font></font></font>

redesign plans may make, can they really substantiate any claim that
their plans are at all &lsquo;in sympathy&rsquo; with either the inherited

would say, vehemently, that the answer to this question is
&ldquo;Absolutely not&rdquo;, and our recommendation is that the above
suggestions of ours are now considered, many of which can be implemented at
little or no cost, will still allow use of the church for appropriate
concerts (concerts which will not permit of so much noise that they cause disturbance to Church Yard
residents, and which are compatible with the sacred holy nature of the
church building, as already adhered to at Hythe, Folkestone &amp; Maidstone Parish
Churches etc), will incorporate the use of the Church Hall much more
often in events (especially more radical forms of worship or concerts
the contents of which would be unsuitable in a church) and will
ensure that this, our noble historic Parish Church of St Mary the
Virgin, Ashford which traces its roots back to mediaeval times,
remains a reverent God-centred building with a lively, loving and
God-fearing congregation, committed to continuing and expressing to
new generations the old, old true story expressed through the Creeds, in line with
the inherited Anglo-Catholic tradition of the place and with the
&ldquo;Catholic Societies of the Church of England&rdquo;; also according to
the doctrine and rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer (the Central book
and formulary of the Church of England), and through beautiful and
worthy music of sufficient standard to complement the worship, by such composers as Beethoven,
Purcell, Tallis, Stanford to mention but a few and performance of the
same to a sufficiently worthy standard by a Choir of good voice as befits this grand and
important town church (distinct as it must be - in striving for the
highest standards of both worship and concert performances - from the
quaint little churches in the suburbs and environs): The crowning
glory of this lovely Market town (which may very well one day be a
City, and this Parish Church, its Cathedral) of Ashford.</big></big></font></font></font></big></big></p>

Issues
to be considered with regard to the proposed re-ordering of Ashford
Parish Church - having particular regard to the Public Consultation
which&nbsp;took place on Friday 15th September 2006 at 5pm in the
Parish Church.</span> <br>










      <br>










In his Vicar's letter of Easter 1956 Canon Maurice Sharp alluded&nbsp;&nbsp;to this parish that&nbsp; "Change there is, and
change there ever must be", but that we should ensure that
the <span style="font-style: italic;">foundations</span>
of our belief and what we do 'in Church' remain the same. &nbsp;Do not
some aspects of a major
re-ordering proposed for this building undermine and mar its grandeur
rather than introducing change which aesthetically improves it?
&nbsp;We
need to view these objects - pews, pulpit, lectern &amp; steps, and
rood screen among them - as more than just physical objects. &nbsp;We
owe
the Victorian middle classes a great debt of gratitude for providing us
with such grand furnishings - the previous reformation style of
furnishing was swept away, and while we might lament such doings (which
were at the behest of the very catholic Oxford Movement) in quaint
country churches, where many a good interior has been thoroughly spoilt
by the Victorians. &nbsp;We contend that the furnishings we have here
today
are of the highest quality, and make the church more dignified than
ever it has been - and obviously the numerous Visitors we have had over
the years agree - just open a Vistors book at the church and you will
see! &nbsp;The building is supposed to edify the congregation -
to lift the hearts and minds of the congregation spiritually above the
humdrum of a drab world - particularly a drab urban area such as
Ashford in our modern age of banality and squalor. &nbsp;We contend

that a great civic building such as ours will not
accomplish that, if the proposed major works are approved, and we will
be robbed forever of the&nbsp;'Jewel in the crown'&nbsp;&nbsp;of
Ashford (so-called a couple of years ago by the local KM newspaper).
&nbsp;The Victorian middle
classes stood for self-respect, independence, thrift, cleanliness,
patriotism and willingness to help our neighbour and our Church.
&nbsp;The
middle classes insisted that only the best would do. &nbsp;Let's
be sure we hold on to this ethos as worthy heirs.<br>

current
pews were purchased by the church, and the number required probably
limited the grand decoration affordable on them. &nbsp;They currently
look
odd and tatty when viewed from the Chancel, on account of the removal
of the two front pews on either side (on a temporary Archdeacon's
licence in c.1999). &nbsp;These pews (one of which was occupied by
H.M. Queen Elizabeth II at the 1970 Jubilation service, although that
plaque has been erroneously re-sited on the current right hand front
pew) are currently stored in the South Transept, and the chairs
formerly there are arranged beneath the pulpit as choir seating.
&nbsp;This
is a most unhappy situation and we are contending that this licence
should be terminated and the pews and their front runners shall be
replaced in the Nave again, which will render the view dignified once
more. &nbsp;The chairs would then be returned to the South Transept,
and the
choir would take up their proper position (as they did until the move
in 1999) in the Chancel choir stalls. &nbsp;The Nave altar would also
be
removed and replaced in the South Transept. &nbsp;The choir will need a
serious recruitment campaign, so that there are enough of them to be
audible in singing from the choir stalls - but youngsters will
certainly be less daunted when they are not stuck right by the
congregation. &nbsp;Music of a sufficiently worthy standard must also
be
provided for the choir - some recent innovations of poorly written and
phrased music have only hastened the choir's decline.<br>










      <br>










The
trouble today in many churches is that, rather than asking themselves
why there has been a serious&nbsp;decline in attendance at services,
the leaders (PCC, Priest and other 'worthies') try to make us believe
that we have to "accept things the way that they are" rather than "as
we might like them to be" (i.e. being zealous and welcoming intelligent
warm people who want a high standard of worship, and using service
forms which encourage such people.) &nbsp;Therefore if a choir is
depleted (usually by reason of being <span style="font-style: italic;">forced</span>
to sing music not worth singing, and other egalitarian devices) they
get shoved next to the congregation because of the claim that they
cannot be heard at a distance (but we have sound systems nowadays if
that were really true), and diminishing congregations are a good excuse
for doing away with pews. &nbsp;Unfortunately, all these things are

just that; excuses. &nbsp;They suit the current agenda of the CofE
hierarchy who are still intent on dumbing things down. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">We want to keep Ashford Parish Church special.</span>

The
church was seated by faculty in 1745, but although those pews were
good craftsmanship, they were box pews which did not look well in
proportion with the pillars of the arcade and tower, and were replaced
in 1879 by the current pews which are much better proportioned, and
lend additional dignity to the interior. &nbsp;In 1879 the North &amp;
South
Transepts and N. side of N.W pillar and S. side of SW pillar were also
pewed, so that the church could accommodate approximately 1700 souls.
&nbsp;Since then: In 1958 a faculty was granted for the removal of six
pews
in the North Transept, two from the East end of the north aisle, four
from the North side of the North-west pillar of the tower, and three
from the south end of the South Aisle. &nbsp;The faculty states that
these
should have been stored for future use in the Church and Church Halls,
but they have long since disappeared - this is what tends to happen
when pews are removed: after a few years they are deliberately
'lost'. &nbsp;In 1969 the remaining pews in the South
Transept were swept away, and some of the wood from them was used to
make the front runners and chairs which were formerly in the South
Transept (but which since c.1999 have been sited in the current
unfortunate position for use of the choir on Sunday mornings.
&nbsp;This is even more concerning when it is known that the chairs
were made and the chapel reoredered in memory of a Parishioner Mr Harry
Knock. &nbsp;To have then reordered this work (even on a temporary
basis) so soon, once more raises questions about the ethics of undoing
work done to the recent memory of an old parishioner
&nbsp;Furthermore in c.1985 two pews were removed from either side of
the
rear of the nave, as well as some from the S. side of the SW pillar due
to re-siting of the font. &nbsp;Hopefully this shows that we have lost
quite
enough pews already, and should definitely retain those now remaining.<br>










      <br>










The
current Nave pews are dignified and geometrically pleasing to the eye
from the
West end (and will be so from the East also, when the front rows and
runners are replaced. &nbsp;Chairs would look awkward, are liable to
tip up
when elderly or disabled members of a congregation try to pull
themselves up on them, and (as proved at Bethersden church when that
was reordered) they provide a lesser amount of seating for the
area they occupy than pews would. &nbsp;Furthermore, chairs will look
ramshackle and haphazard: totally out of keeping with the building,
presenting a very poor effect. &nbsp;Removal of the pews will -
whatever is
said - also effectively result in the nave becoming something akin to a
dumbed-down concert hall, and only the chancel will be a church.
&nbsp;We
contend that filling the pews with inhabitants on Sundays is a far more
cost-effective way of using this beautiful building (after all this was
the use for whic it ever has been and ever should continue to be) - and
a
thoughtful and caring worshipping community will only be built once
useless modernising innovations&nbsp;- like certain aspects of this
proposed reordering - cease, and those who propound them are deposed.

&nbsp;The louvres on the tower are starting to look shabby and need
replacing, and the Carillon&nbsp;which plays a selection of tunes (at
9am, 12 noon, 6pm and 9pm) on each day of the week also needs putting
into working order.&nbsp; Two new bells could be added to increase the
ring to 12 bells altogether, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if desired</span> by the parishioners.<br>
