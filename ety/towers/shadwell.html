      <p>1728 - Captain James Cook was born in Upper Shadwell on Oct 7th.&nbsp;
      He was married at Barking on Dec 21st 1762.&nbsp; The Banns were read at
      Shadwell three Sundays prior to this "Captain James Cook, batchelor
      of St Pauls Shadwell, and Elizabeth Batts of St Margaret's, Barking,
      Essex.&nbsp; This is for the first/second/third time of asking.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1770 - 1790 Between these dates John Wesley preached at least 10 times
      at St Pauls between these dates.&nbsp; The last entry in his 'Journal'
      reads "Sunday October 24th 1790" I explained to a numerous
      congregation in Spitalfields Church 'The whole armour of God".&nbsp;
      St Pauls Shadwell was still more croded in the afternoon, while I enforced
      that important truth 'One thing is needful' and I hope that many even then
      resolved to choose the better part."&nbsp; Wesley was 87 when he made
      this entry.&nbsp; Within five months he was dead.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1810 - A fall of a small part of the ceiling near the pulpit shortly
      before Divine Service one Sunday morning caused the congregation
      considerable alarm, and they crowded out of the building in confusion and
      consternation and "dispersed in every direction".&nbsp; Upon
      expert examination and a careful survey the Church was declared unsafe for
      use for Divine Service, and was shut up for use, except for Christenings
      and burials.&nbsp; Marriages took place at St George-in-the-East.</p>

      <p>1816 - After a good deal of discussion it was resolved to demolish the
      church.&nbsp; By 1816, most of the previous edifice had gone.&nbsp;</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1819 - The old church having been razed to the ground, preparations were made
      for the erection of a new 'Waterloo Church', paid for by monies raised
      from the Battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Shadwell was the most expensive of all
      these 'Waterloo Churches'&nbsp; A new ring of eight bells was cast by Thos
      Mears II for the tower from the metal of the old bells, with additional
      metal.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1820 - The present Church was built by John Walters.&nbsp; The total
      cost of the building of the Church&nbsp; and including all interior
      fixtures was &pound;16,500.&nbsp; The bells were hung in a new wooden frame.&nbsp; The bells were
      very large considering the slender proportions of the tower.&nbsp; The
      installation might be described as a 'shoe-horn job'.&nbsp; </p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Tuesday Oct 2nd 1821 - The first peal, 5040 Grandsire Triples was rung
      by the Junior Society of Cumberland Youths, who appear to have provided
      ringing at this period at a number of other towers in the vicinity - on
      the 8 at All Hallows, Barking by the tower, the old Lester and Pack 8 at S
      Matthew Bethnal Green (bells destroyed by fire in 1860) and at St Dunstan
      Stepney.&nbsp; Two days after this peal, the architect of the church, John
      Walters died, aged 39.</p>

      <p>1849 - A receipt from Thos Payne, Gun and Brass metal dealer, Holborn
      Hill (found under the ringing room floor in the recent restoration) seems
      to denote that a new bearing had been turned for one of the bells
      (possibly the treble).</p>

      <p>1840's - 1900 - The Ancient Society of College Youths appear to have
      provided the ringing between these dates, probably mainly due to the
      efforts of Mr William Cooter the Conductor.&nbsp; In the latter part of
      the 19th century, George and William Tanner appear to have been
      steeplekeepers.&nbsp; A vast quantity of peals were rung on the bells,
      generally either Grandsire or Stedman Triples or Kent TB Major.&nbsp; One
      of Double Norwich was rung in 1894, and one of Single Oxford Triples in
      1896.&nbsp; Wm Cooter was well known for having very strict views on
      standards of striking, and it is likely that he did not want Surprise to
      be rung on the bells (though he did ring in a peal of Superlative S. at
      Bethnal Green in 1850 for the St James Society (now London C.A.).</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>March 10th 1900 - The last peal on the bells; Holts Original Grandsire
      Triples by the ASCY.</p>






      
      
      
      



      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>&nbsp;1910 - The
      bearings of the bells had been quite worn out by this time because of all
      the peals, and maintenance is not easy because of space restrictions.&nbsp;
      This coupled with the dust from the Industrial Revolution which blew into
      the tower and&nbsp; formed an abrasive acidic paste in the bearings caused excessive wear.&nbsp;
      Minor repairs were carried out to the bells in 1910, which included
      repairing wheels, and other major deficiencies in the installation such as
      weaknesses in the frame.&nbsp; At this time too, the top trestle of the
      bellframe was wedged to the wall.&nbsp; These wedges were removed in the
      1999 - 2000 restoration, as they can seriously damage the tower through a
      "battering ram" effect.&nbsp; The gudgeons and bearings may have
      received minor attention, but only one bearing on the 3rd and one on the
      treble were replaced.</p>


      
      
      <p>1912&nbsp;William
      Cooter died in 1912 aged 87.<a href="images/cooterw.jpg"> Details.....&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
It may be presumed that Wm Cooter who would have been nearly 80 by 1900
could no longer commit himself to organising or taking part in ringing
at Shadwell. He had for many years also been a full member of the St
Pauls Cathedral band but had resigned at Michaelmas 1908 due to failing
eyesight and&nbsp;inability to ascend that tower, and his place in that
band was taken by T.H. Taffender.&nbsp; Without the influence of Mr
Cooter and his contemporaries, the ASCY drifted away from
Shadwell.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;1920 - 1930 - The tower was in union with the Middlesex Assn
      &amp; London DG at this time.&nbsp; No peals were scored in this period,
      though, which does seem surprising, particularly with the Pye brothers who
      were active members of that Society.&nbsp; One would have thought that if
      anyone could score a peal on the bells at this time (whatever the
      standard) it would have been the 'Pye' peal band.</p>

      <p>1930 - 1956 - Some mischievous character set the bells up for clocking
      during this period. This was probably due to the worn bearings and
      subsequent fact that there probably weren't any bands who were prepared to
      put the effort into either ringing the bells as they were, or restoring
      them.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1948 - The Clock (erected by Thwaites and Reed of Clerkenwell in 1820)
      was repaired and overhauled &pound;175; War Damage and &pound;37; Other Repairs.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1951 - Parish amalgamated with St James Ratcliffe, which was destroyed
      in the second world war.&nbsp; The present day St Katherines Foundation
      stands on the site of Ratcliffe church.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1956 - The tercentenary of the building of the old Shadwell
      Church.&nbsp; Much work was undertaken on the fabric of the Church,
      following wartime neglect.&nbsp; The only objects which received no
      attention were the bells.&nbsp; However, there were plans to 'rehang the
      bells and enable a peal to be rung', the cost of which would have been
      &pound;1500.&nbsp; Money ran out, and instead of the rehang, the louvres were
      fitted with new copper grilles, and the belfry thoroughly cleaned out, at
      a cost of &pound;229.</p>

      <p>1960's - Mr Uphill carried out some basic work on the installation,
      rendering them ringable for short periods.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1982? - Various sources have reported that in 1982, the second bell
      shot out of the frame.&nbsp; The reason for this is that
      the clapper which had become very loose and worn connected with a large
      foundation beam supporting the top tier framework and vaulted the bell out
      of the frame.&nbsp; After this the bells were not rung again.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Late 1980's - Mr R. Booth is believed to have inspected the bells and
      pronounced them beyond repair.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>1999 - Mr C.J. Cooper inspected the bells and set about putting them
      into order so that they could be rung for short periods with the express
      intention of conserving as much of the original installation as
      possible.&nbsp; A summary of the restoration which took place between 1999
      and June 2001 is: - Entire belfry, clock room and ringing room cleaned out
      (15 sacks of fine dust collected from the belfry alone!), reasonable ropes
      provided,&nbsp; second put back into frame - all other bells
      removed from bearings, bearings cleaned out, bells rehung on original
      gudgeons and bearings - new wheels made for bells 2 &amp; 8 incorporating
      as much original wood as possible - new stays on bells 2, 4 and 5; new
      slider on Treble.&nbsp; Original slider of the fourth modified and re-used&nbsp;
      -
      All frame bolts tightened - All metalwork painted - headstock strap on 3
      repaired - wheels on 1,3,4,6 and 7 considerably strengthened - wooden
      clapper tops replaced on 2,3,5,6 and 8 - Many worn clapper bolts replaced
      - top coat of black bitumen paint applied to all metalwork - clappers
      painted with black shanks, red balls and gold flights.&nbsp; The total
      cost of this work was &pound;850.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>January 2001 - Service Ledgers and other books relating to St James
      Ratcliffe were discovered in a small box in the Church and placed in a
      secure place.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>30th June 2001 - Bells reopened with a service of BCP 1662 Holy
      Communion followed by rededication and naming of the bells.&nbsp; Opening
      ringing consisted of call-changes and two courses of Bob Major.&nbsp; It
      was generally agreed that the bells are exceedingly challenging to
      ring.&nbsp; This service marked the completion of Phase One of the
      restoration project.&nbsp;</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>9th July 2001 - Bolt in gudgeon of third discovered to have worked
      itself loose from the headstock, as it had been let in the wrong way up
      (with no washers) and bolted at the bottom rather than the top (The same
      arrangement exist on the Treble and second.) The looseness of the gudgeon
      plate makes it work unsteadily in the frame, and so is not rung now.&nbsp;
      The wear of the gudgeons and bearings on the third is particularly
      excessive, as it was for many years used as the sanctus bell, without the
      bearings having been greased.&nbsp;</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>July 2001 - Many old Church rate, Burial and Service Ledgers relating
      to St Paul, Shadwell were discovered in the basement of the Rectory.&nbsp;
      These were believed to have been destroyed by an air-raid in the second
      world war (as indeed some of the old parish records undoubtedly
      were).&nbsp; Sadly however, they have been very seriously damaged by damp,
      and will need much restoration, which is to be undertaken shortly.&nbsp;
      In addition to handwritten books, there is also a large volume of a
      History of London from the 1790's and a Church Law dictionary from
      1792.&nbsp; There is a plan to store the restored books in a suitable
      cabinet in the ringing chamber.&nbsp; Other interesting (and more recent)
      items were also found, in rather better condition, and appear to have been
      placed in the basement by the Rev Basil Edward Toussaint Jansz, incumbent
      from 1939-1968.&nbsp; These discoveries enabled a review of this history,
      and means that we can now account for the condition of the bells
      throughout the 20th century.&nbsp; All these books were placed in a secure
      place, along with the Ratcliffe books, found in January.</p>

      <p>28th Aug 2001 - At the request of the Archdeacon, Mr A. Frost,
Diocesan Bell Advisor for London inspected the bells.&nbsp; It was his
opinion that the front 6 bells should be rehung to cut down on the
shock loading in the frame.&nbsp; Rehanging will take place using the
original brasses and gudgeons, refilled, reamed out, and turned up on a
lathe. &nbsp;ENGLISH HERITAGE will be involved.&nbsp; Following this
work, the top tier frame will be secured to the tower by means of RSJ's
built into the walls.&nbsp;</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>2001 - REV R. THEO SIMPSON RETIRES AS THE LAST RECTOR OF SHADWELL.</p>






      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>2004 - Notwithstanding the considerable effort which Mr Cooper
had put into restoring the bells, certain "Clerics" in nearby parishes
plotted to remove him from the Church Council and Electoral Roll.
&nbsp;However, fortunately the Churchwardens support the efforts of
ASETWY, &nbsp;and have ensured that, though many others have tried to
gain control of the bells in order to 'rip everything out and start
again', this will not be allowed, and though it will take time, St
Paul's will eventually be the oldest ringing bells in the country
hanging on virtually
all their original fittings.<br>
