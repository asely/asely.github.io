            There was about &pound;15 in the bell fund which was used to buy two new
            panes of glass for the handbell cabinets.&nbsp; The handbells, now
            locked away in a safe away from the tower, the space left was used
            for storing the many volumes of the Bell News and Ringing World.&nbsp;
            The bearings of the bells (which like all Bowells bearings have
            lasted incredibly well in spite of the lack of maintenance) were
            'flushed out'.&nbsp; The real
            trouble however is that the lack of maintenance means that the
            clappers drift from one side of the bell to the other in some
            cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

            bells (the first for some time) to mark the 101st birthday of H.M.
            The Queen Mother.&nbsp; Mr Cooper rang the 7-8 'double-handed', and

            <td>The clappers of 3, 5 &amp; 7 were drifting from one
side of the bells to the other, sometimes hitting the wheels during
ringing. &nbsp;This unacceptable state of affairs was rectified by C.J.
Cooper, and just in time, as the leathers on these clapper hoops had
worn right through. &nbsp;These leather 'baldricks' were replaced by Mr
Cooper, thus saving some very expensive damage which would have occured
in time to both the wheels, clapper hoops, and possibly the bells if
the clappers had torn out during a ringing session.<br>

Pictured
is one of the clappers with it's hoop and worn leathers from its
clapper and that of another bell. &nbsp;Note the shiny area inside the
hoop which was well worn. &nbsp;The work carried out by Mr Cooper will
clearly last for many years, and is common sense - but this still did
not stop individuals of the Kent County Association of Changeringers
(wearing the usual 'personal vendetta' hat) from rubbishing the work
carried out - then promptly holding a district Meeting there. &nbsp;We
leave it to you, dear reader to work the logic in that! </div>
