<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">The main activists in the
St James&rsquo;s Society were also very often the chief peal conductors
for the Society too.  Thus we find the earliest conductor was Thomas
Tolladay, who did much for the advancement and rejuvenation of London
ringing generally.  He lived and worked in the Parish, and conducted
51 peals for the Society.  The 70</font><sup><font size="3">th</font></sup><font size="3">
peal for the Society was rung to his memory; he having died in
October 1843.  It was in 1843 that the 3</font><sup><font size="3">rd</font></sup><font size="3">
bell cracked and was recast by George Oliver &ndash; a worker at
Whitechapel foundry &ndash; at his small workshop in Bethnal Green, using
moulds borrowed from the foundry.  In like manner he cast two new
trebles in 1844, making the ring up to ten.  Those who rang on the
bells before their destruction in the war testify that they were an


exceedingly fine ring of ten.</font></p>



<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">William Dunn was one of the first main
activists in the St James's Society. &nbsp;He was the first recorded
Master (and had also been&nbsp;Master of the Society of College
Youths), and it may well have been due in no small part to him that the
St James's Society HQ was moved to St Clements in 1839. &nbsp;He was an
outstanding handbell founder as well as a practical ringer, and had a
workshop at 35 Carey Street (near St Clement Danes) and also at one or
two other locations including Bloomsbury &amp; Kings Cross. &nbsp;A set
of 16 of his handbells bought by Leeds Parish Church, Kent in 1842
(unwisely sold in 1933 and then repurchased by the church in 2003) are
still in regular use for Christmas Carol tune-ringing and occasional
changeringing by the Leeds Society of Handbell Ringers, and pictures of
&nbsp;these bells and their box are shown below. &nbsp;The date on the
box is 1842, and the bells are quite unusual as they are hemispherical.
&nbsp;They have a beautiful tone.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">George Stockham was the
regular peal conductor following Tolladay&rsquo;s demise.  He conducted
61 peals for the Society altogether; the last in 1869.  Stockham was
an interesting character &ndash; for many years he was Steeplekeeper of
St Clement Danes.  He was well respected in the College Youths, and
rang many peals for that Society, also.  He had taken over the
premises formerly occupied by William Dunn (a handbell founder of
note, and the first recorded Master of the St James&rsquo;s Society) and
continued to cast handbells.  He was also responsible for the
disastrous augmentation of the bells of Hythe, Kent to 10 in July 1861. 
The story appeared to run that Stockham had agreed to supply two new
trebles to Hythe.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">John Friend was the Conductor of the Hythe band,
and a member of the College Youths, and Stockham had agreed with him to cast
two trebles for Hythe.  However, it appears that, Stockham realising that he
had not the wherewithal to cast church bells at his little workshop
in Carey Street, he purchased two bells from Whitechapel Foundry and
chiselled the Mears lettering off!  This put the bells horrendously
out of tune so that when they were installed and rung the inhabitants
of the town fled to the seafront to escape the terrible noise!  The
evidence in the ensuing court case can be read&nbsp;</font><font size="3"><a style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" href="images/hythedebacle.htm">here.</a></font><font size="3">
  Stockham appeared to win the day (probably rather unjustly), and it
seems that Friend never rang with the College Youths in London again.
 The two trebles remained in storage at Hythe until 1891 when they
were broken up and used to defray the cost of recasting the 7</font><sup><font size="3">th</font></sup><font size="3">
&amp; Tenor there.&nbsp;</font></p>




<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">Still, Stockham was well
regarded as a man of integrity in the College
Youths and the London ringing scene in general - he had, indeed made St
Clement Danes the chief meeting point of all the London towers, and was
also a member of the band who rang the long peal of&nbsp;</font><a style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" href="gallery/bethgrn/beth07.jpg">8580 Stedman Cinques at Cornhill in 1861</a><font size="3">, and featuring in one of the

Steeplekeeping at St Clement Danes in 1870, and occupied the position
until 1898 when he was not re-elected.  He was so bitterly
shocked and disappointed that he died the following year, and the bells were rung
half muffled to his memory.  Another famous old member &lsquo;Toppy&rsquo;
Langdon died the same year, and again, the bells were rung half
muffled.</font><br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"><font size="3">E. Alexander Young was a
great character of the Exercise.  He was a member of the St James&rsquo;s
Society (renamed as the LCA in 1903).  He was always most interested
in reviving old traditions, and in some cases introducing new ones! 
As a practical ringer he was, by his own admission, fairly hopeless. 
But his great contribution to the Society was in his designing of a
splendid membership certificate......&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">He also
designed the ASCY Master&rsquo;s badge which was presented to that
Society in 1937 &ndash; its tercentenary year.  E.A. Young learned to
ring at St Clement Danes in about 1890.  He rang his first rounds
there one Sunday evening and said of it &ldquo;I wish to draw a veil over
my effort, having been roundly admonished for it by H.R. (&lsquo;Bob&rsquo;)
Newton.&rdquo;  Once Young was a proficient ringer, he was elected a
member of the St James&rsquo;s Society at its meeting place, &lsquo;The Essex
Head&rsquo; which was just off a side-road, hard by St Clement Danes. 
Having become a reliable &lsquo;tenor behind&rsquo; man, he decided he had no
particular desire to advance further in the Art, and with the
first-rate local band at St Clement&rsquo;s at the time &ndash; &ldquo;those old
boys were all masters of their art; it was a joy to listen to and
watch them at their work&rdquo;, he had no desire to become involved in
ringing &lsquo;inside&rsquo;.  He was St James&rsquo;s Society Secretary from
1892-1894.</font><br>

course, a great activist in the St James&rsquo;s Society (and later as
the LCA) and held the office of Master from 1897-1903, following
which its name changed to the London County Association.  He learnt
to ring at St John&rsquo;s, Wilton Road (hard by Victoria Station) in the
1880&rsquo;s and later became very involved in the St James&rsquo;s Society
and the College Youths.  He conducted 33 peals for the Society and
was an absolutely first-rate ringer and conductor on tower and
handbells, and a very staunch and devoted high Churchman held in the highest esteem by all his contemporaries.</font><br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">Henry R.(Bob) Newton was
another regular St James&rsquo;s Society supporter, and a renowned
heavy
bell ringer, especially with the College Youths. He rang many of the
heavy London tenors to peals and attempted to turn Exeter Cathedral
Tenor into a peal of Treble-bob twelve, though he unfortunately did not
suceed in this tough undertaking.</font><br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="3">In 1893, E. Alexander Young
observed that the original 8 at St Clement&rsquo;s (3</font><sup><font size="3">rd</font></sup><font size="3">
of which had been recast in 1843) celebrated their bicentenary, and
he 'sounded out' the Rector, Rev. Lindsey with regard to attempting a
peal for the occasion.  The Churchwardens promised a supper and to
bear the cost of a peal board marking the occasion, and the ringers
jumped at the idea.  The other ringers arranged the band, but Young&rsquo;s
name was left out! &nbsp;He determined that he should ring in the peal as
it had been his idea in the first place, and the Rector supported
him, and told the other ringers to &lsquo;give the lad a chance&rsquo;.  Thus
the other members had to agree to Young ringing the Tenor.  Some of
them however were displeased at having been got into this position,
and determined to teach Young a lesson!  They filled the bearings up
with grit in order to make the bell run badly and wear him out, but
they overdid it, and 40 minutes into the peal the bell set and could
not be pulled off again!  The peal was thus postponed for three
months whilst William E. Albone (the Steeplekeeper) attempted to make
the bell run well again, but the bearings had been ruined, and two
men had to be employed to ring the </font><font size="3">peal</font><font size="3">
using two separate ropes &ndash; Young was not one of them.  A board was
subscribed for and was hung in the porch.  It was destroyed when the
church was bombed in 1941. &nbsp;Because of the damage to the bearings the Tenor had to be rehung in 1894 by
Mears &amp; Stainbank.</font></p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">St James's Society [Est. 1824].</span></h2>
















It has been 104 years, but now the old St James' Society [Established
in 1824] is working again with an image to match that of the old times.
&nbsp;Whilst the old LCA had patches of success, it - unfortunately -
was cared for very little in latter years, and was supposedly closed.
&nbsp;It would appear this was to satisfy various ends. &nbsp;The St.
James Society, in striking contrast to the LCA was a much smaller
organisation which aimed at a certain way of carrying on, rather than
trying to emulate many of the County Associations which had sprung up
at the time of the renaming and enlargement of the old St James'
Society into the LCA. &nbsp;The LCA served its purpose in its time, and
could have had a future, but ultimately this would have involved
shaking off its image, and it would appear that few wished to bother
with that. &nbsp;Practices will be arranged to suit those wishing to
advance themselves in the Art within London, placed above a territorial
Association level, but below the standard for the two senior London
Societies. &nbsp;Whilst it will be useful to assist persons wishing to
advance their ringing, it will also be as well for folk to note that it
is a common misconception that the St James' Society was originally
formed to allow ASCY and SRCY members to ring peals together, and this
is not at all an aim of the current Society, any more than it was the
aim of those who began the original St James' Society. &nbsp;Until the
1850's the St James' Society was simply a Society which &nbsp;was
founded in part by Thomas Tolladay from a society calling itself
&nbsp;"The Westminster Youths" and Established about the year 1800.
&nbsp;Tolladay was very keen to revive ringing in London which had
reached a low ebb. &nbsp;From the 1850's, members of both SRCY and ASCY
rang peals under the name of The St James' Society simply as a flag of
convenience to allow them to ring peals of particularly Stedman Cinques
on handbells and, for instance, the 3rd peal of Superlative ever rung
(on tower bells at St Matthew's Bethnal Green) on 9th February 1850.
&nbsp;It is an important distinction to make here that the &nbsp;St
James' Society was never founded as a way of members of ASCY/SRCY
ringing peals together, and thus there is no suggestion that the
current Society should be seeking to do this; rather more lately a St
James' Guild seems to be used to this end.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The above picture was taken outside
St. Clement Danes at the 1926 AGM
of the St James's Society (which was then called The London County
Association) &nbsp;It includes Challis F. Winney (fourth from the
right, 2nd to back row) who was a lifelong supporter of the ringing at
St. Clement Danes arranged by The St James's Society (and later as the
LCA) and was Master of the St James's Society from 1897-1903, when its
name was changed to The London County Association of Change Ringers.
&nbsp;He was
also a distinguished member of ASCY. &nbsp;Also pictured 5th from right
2nd row from the front is E. Alexander Young, another stalwart of The
St. James's Society (and later as the LCA) and of the ASCY. &nbsp;He
designed the Membership Certificate of the LCA, and the Master's Badges
of the LCA and ASCY. &nbsp;The Rector, Rev. W. Pennington-Bickford
(sitting next to the Master) had a long association as Rector of St
Clement Danes, his father-in-law having been Rector before him.
&nbsp;Sadly,
following the destruction of St Clement Danes in the Blitz, Rev.
Pennington Bickford apparently took his own life. &nbsp;The Master,
Thomas H.
Taffender was Master for 50 years (1913-63) and did much for training
of new ringers in London. &nbsp;Although a good ringer himself, he was
eventually virtually ostracised in ASCY circles (he was a member, and a
St Paul's ringer) due to his habit of getting inexperienced ringers
through a peal of a new method and having them elected to ASCY by a
belfry election prior to a peal. &nbsp;It was for this reason that
belfry elections to ASCY were later prohibited. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
the LCA never really managed to lose this reputation, which played a
part in its eventual downfall.</span><br>

<h2>A brief History of the Companies of The Eastern Youths, The Trinity Youths of Deptford &nbsp;and The Westminster Youths<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2>
















      
<p>&nbsp;The name encompasses two
      great old London Ringing Companies.&nbsp; The first is the Eastern Youths
      of London, established probably around 1690.&nbsp; Little is known about
      them other than the fact that they gave two trebles to St Magnus the
      Martyr, Lower Thames Street in 1718.&nbsp; It is likely that the Eastern
      Scholars who formed later in the 18th Century were the result of an
      amalgamation between the Eastern Youths and British Scholars.</p>

















      
      
<p>The Trinity Youths of Deptford were established in 1782.&nbsp; They
      were based at St Nicholas Deptford (A complete&nbsp;Newton &amp; Hadley 8 from 1701,
      outrageously scrapped at the end of the Second World War).&nbsp; The Society
      faded out in the early part of the 19th Century, and was re-established
      in the 1870's, only to suffer a similar decline 20 or so years
      later.&nbsp; In their second establishment they rang at Greenwich,
      Deptford (St Johns) and some other towers in the vicinity.</p>

















      
      
<p>The Westminster Youths were formed in the late 18th Century by
Thomas Tolladay.&nbsp; They were only a minor Company of ringers and
faded out quite quickly, though the Society was re-established at St
James Clerkenwell in 1824 as the St James's Society, which later became
The London County Association and lately has been continued, again as
the St James's Society.</p>

















      
      
<p>The St James's Society continues today
      with its maintenance work, particularly focussing on
      preservation of interesting and rare installations, and historical
      towers.&nbsp; It provides ringers for special occasions by Church Request
      at St Paul Shadwell, St Matthew Bethnal Green and St
      John Deptford.</p>
