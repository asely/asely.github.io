            included James Dwight (an excellent heavy-bell ringer who rang the
            tenor at St Michael, Cornhill to the legendary <a href="gallery/bethgrn/beth07.jpg">8580 Steman Cinques in 1861</a> and composed a&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:/Users/cjc/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/YYG7BSP3/dwightssong%5B1%5D.jpg"></a><a href="images/dwightssong.jpg">song in doggerel verse</a><a href="images/dwightssong.jpg"></a> which he used to sing at the Ancient Society of College Youths

            member; somewhat younger than Dwight, and became a founder member of
            the band at St Pauls Cathedral.&nbsp; After 1910 the link between
            the College Youths was maintained, but in a much looser form - the
            Society would still ring occasional peals on the bells, and held
            practices there from time-to-time.&nbsp; Stepney bells were always
            held in high regard by the old London ringers on account of their
            excellent tonal qualities. <br>

largest Parish in the world, it was peculiarly fitting then that the
awful disaster to the 'Titanic' should be commemorated at St Dunstan's
by a muffled Peal, rung on May 9th, by request of the Vicar, Rev. G.C.
Wilton. &nbsp;Another, and perhaps the primary reason which associates
the Peal with the disaster is that some of those who perished went away
from the East-End, among them the Rev. and Mrs.Carter. &nbsp;The peal,
5007 Stedman Quators was conducted by Mr Herbert Langdon. &nbsp;Many
people assembled in the church grounds to listen. &nbsp;The thanks of
the ringers, whose names appear in our peal columns, are tendered to
the Rector for the use of the bells, and to the towerkeeper for having
them in such good going order.<br>
