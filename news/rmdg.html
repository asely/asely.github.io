NEW MAJOR METHOD FOR THE TOWN OF NEW ROMNEY!<br>

      <p><big><big><font color="#ffffff">The bells of New Romney were
ringing on the late August Bank Holiday Monday 2009: ringing out a
brand new peal never performed&nbsp;before.&nbsp; It was successfully
completed in 2 hours
and 56 minutes and as the performance satisfies all the rules of the
Central Council of Church Bellringers&nbsp; the performance
has been named after the town and is thus called New Romney Delight
Major.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></big></big></p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><big><big><font color="#ffffff">Mr C.J. Cooper - who lives at Ashford Church Yard and is a
member of Ashford Parish Church and its bellringing team - arranged
the team for this New Romney peal.&nbsp; Since 2005, he has taught most of the
current local team of New Romney bellringers to handle a bell, as New
Romney bells had not previously had a proper local team for many
years.&nbsp; There are now about twenty eager local ringers of all
ages at New Romney with their own local Captain, Mr David Jackson,
and Mr Cooper instructs the ringers in changeringing on Monday
practice nights.&nbsp; Of the Bank Holiday Monday peal, Mr Cooper
said: "We are most fortunate that such a competent team of
ringers could be assembled.&nbsp; We had no
opportunity to practise this new method before starting for the peal
so there were a few brief mistakes in the early part of the peal due
to the method being quite like&nbsp;Bristol Surprise, which we all ring regularly; but the
final two hours were very settled and excellently rung and the method
is extremely musical, evidenced by the recording made of the first hour of the peal.&nbsp; New Romney can be proud that this new
method has been named after the town - most towns have a&nbsp;method
named after them"</font></big></big></p>

by custom, the fourth Saturday of January saw a contingent of both
local and country members of the Romney Marsh &amp; District Guild
converge on the District for the usual enjoyable AGM day.  Ringing
began at 1:30pm with a Quarter Peal attempt for Grandsire Triples at
Mersham, conducted by the Secretary, though this had to be set up
early due to a preponderence of errors in the ringing.&nbsp; At
2:30pm, the band returned to the tower, and swelled by a number of
other members as well as a few visitors, the bells were put to good
use until 3:30pm, with the usual call-changes, Grandsire &amp;
Stedman Triples as well as the special methods of Kent, Forward and
Duffield all being rung to a good standard.&nbsp; The old Ashford
band was well represented in the company, as also members of the
local team, New Romney, Hothfield, Burmarsh, and further afield:
towers in London and a number of our regular supporters from Aston
Clinton/Aylesbury area, as well as visitors from Thanet and Sussex
border.</big></big></big></font></font></font><br>

Service of Solemn Choral Evensong was as grand an occasion as ever
might be, particularly as, for the first time, it was arranged
jointly as a Canterbury Diocese Prayer Book Society service; readily
agreed by all to have been a splendid occasion, with the congregation
numbering about 40: ringers, PBS Members and some Parishioners, and
the full Boys&rsquo; and Mens&rsquo; Church Choir leading the music,
including the Office Hymn for the Feast of the Conversion, Mag &amp;
Nunc (Stanford in Bb), and the Epiphany Anthem &ldquo;From the Rising of

at Burmarsh immediately preceded the AGM, held at the Shepherd &amp;
Crook, behind the Church.  Burmarsh are not the easiest six to
handle, but due to the unavailability of New Romney because of
restoration of the tower, the ringing had to be moved to Burmarsh. 
Nevertheless, the bells were rung to Kent T.B. and London Surprise,
as well as the usual Grandsire Doubles and call-changes.</big></big></big></font></font></font><br>

splendid supper awaited the party; as usual the qulaity of the food
at The Shepherd &amp; Crook was second to none.  The majority of the
group of 18 members enjoyed Roast Beef, although arrangements had
been made for some members who wished for a different main course. 
During the meal, some Bob Minor was rung on the handbells by: B.D.
Kipling 1-2; J.S. White 3-4 &amp; C.J. Cooper 5-6.  Following
dessert, the meeting opened at approximately 8:55pm.  The Secretary
apologised that none of the Guild property was present, but that this
was due to the current inaccessibility of the belfry at New Romney;
and that it was just good fortune that he had removed the minute book
from the tower a few weeks previously, or else holding the AGM would
have been very difficult!  The usual Business was transacted; the
Officers being elected as follows: Master: B.D. Kipling, Secretary:
C.J. Cooper, Treasurer: D.H. Gower, Committee: Mrs A. Paine, J.
Trewin.  A large number of ratifications prior to peals and quarters
were accepted and four new members elected.  Members stood in silence
as a token of respect to the late Mr T. Cornelius, a stalwart of the
Appledore band for very many years, and the Secretary particularly
wished to record the amazing work which Mr Cornelius undertook on the
rebuilding of the wheels of 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; Tenor at Shadwell,
London E. in 2000; his skill being evident in the fact that
clearances between bell, wheel &amp; frame were so tight, and yet he
had rebuilt the wheels remotely and then assembled them in the tower,
with all fitting perfectly.</big></big></big></font></font></font><br>

visit to Sarre Windmill was first undertaken at 11am, where most of
the outing party convened, and after taking tea, ascended the old
mill.&nbsp; This proved to be a most interesting occasion and a
splendid way to begin the day.&nbsp; Driving on to Birchington, an
early arrival was made at Quex Park, and a suitable area found to
relax while some enjoyed a picnic lunch, and others began their quest
for the local Gadds Ales thanks to the farm shop nearby.&nbsp; The
ringing at Quex Park began at 1:30pm, and we were most grateful for
the assistance of several of the ringers from the local area, which
ensured that some method ringing could be enterprised upon.&nbsp; As
well as some very acceptable call-changes on twelve (including the
Whittington change) in which two New Romney ringers rang their first
blows on twelve, a good three leads of Bristol S. Major was rung on
the back eight, and a musical touch of 171 Stedman Quators.&nbsp;
After an hour-and-a-half at this interesting tower, at which all the
New Romney ringers worked very hard in ringing their first blows on
twelve, it was time to depart for the light eight at All Saints
Church &ndash; having first taken a view from the top of Quex tower and
visited the bells.</font>&nbsp;</font></p>

Saints being half the weight of New Romney, very easy-going and
relatively fast turning, came as something of a shock to the New
Romney band!&nbsp; Unfortunately the ringing never really settled
down, although a good short touch of Grandsire Triples was
accomplished.</font>&nbsp;</font></p>

final tower of the day, Eastry - where the bells had only been
&lsquo;opened&rsquo; twenty-one days before our visit -&nbsp; being a more
similar weight to New Romney, the ringing was much better, and
generally pleasing.&nbsp; Another touch of Grandsire Triples was
successfully brought round, and, upon suggestion of the Secretary who
had rung on the old five many years before, a 60 of Grandsire Doubles
was rung on the old back five.&nbsp; The Guild Master, Mr B.D.
Kipling, had been responsible for tuning the splendid old Catlin
Tenor, and the front four of the ring of eight, and it was heartily
agreed that he had done a good job and that the bells sounded very
well in harmony one with another, and told a very pleasant tale.</font>&nbsp;</font></p>

ringing thus accomplished, a grand supper at The Grove Ferry Inn,
awaited.&nbsp; Ten of the outing party sat down to a delicious
supper; some to braised steak, others to a delicious salmon, or
roasted vegetables, and then a mouthwatering selection of desserts
followed.&nbsp; After coffee had been taken, the Master arose and
thanked all members for their attendance, for the effort they had all
put in to carrying the day off so well, and to the Secretary for
organising most of the proceedings.&nbsp; The Secretary, in response,
thanked the Master for presiding over the ringing at All Saints and
Eastry, for procuring the bells at Eastry for the Guild outing, and
further, wished to heartily congratulate him on the splendid tuning
job he had carried out on Eastry bells on behalf of the Whitechapel
Foundry (applause).&nbsp; In closing, he thanked all Guild members,
and especially the New Romney ringers, for their continuing and
enthusiastic support for both ringing generally, and for the good
work of the Guild, especially those who had provided transport for
the outing.&nbsp; He also wished to note the invaluable support of
Mrs Payne, and Messrs White &amp; Trewin from &lsquo;up country&rsquo;, with
both the ringing on this outing, and support for the Guild
generally.&nbsp; Country members were an invaluable commodity.</font></font></p>

formalities at an end, the Master, Secretary and Miss R. Davey,
having noticed two large bells (one Warner, one G&amp;J) hanging up
in an adjacent bar area, and having first asked permission of the
landlord, invited the company to watch an attempt for a course of
Original Singles on these two bells and a rather dull sounding glass
lampshade!&nbsp; This having been achieved, the company slowly broke
up, and journeyed back to Romney Marsh &amp; District.</font></font></p>

have such a good Churchman Rev. John Cowling as (what is termed these
days as) Focal Minister to the Parish. &nbsp;Rev. Cowling had a long
and distinguished ministry prior to retirement, and he is continuing
his good works with us on the Marsh. &nbsp;There are precious few
decent Clergy left 'in service' these days (so to speak) but Rev.
Cowling is one of them. &nbsp;He shines as a beacon of virtue in the
Parish and is well known to the Parishioners for his kindly disposition
and appreciation and advancement of all that is good and right in the
Church. &nbsp;For far too long, Burmarsh had suffered tyrants or
bleeding heart liberals as Clergy, but now, by the Grace of God the
interior is adorned magnificently with the correct and beautiful altar
hangings which had for so long lain in disuse, and the worship is as
often as possible taken from our incomparable 1662 Book of Common
Prayer - that book of Doctrine and Liturgy which marks us out as true
Churchmen in the Church of England. &nbsp;We have Rev. Cowling to thank
for such wise advances and we owe him such a debt of gratitude as can
never be repaid. &nbsp;We shall hope for very many happy years to come
with him in Burmarsh; how truly blessed this small village church is.<br>

We are much saddened to have to report the death of Lord Deedes, at the
grand old age of 94. &nbsp;He was a great man, and his like will never
be seen again. &nbsp;A peal was&nbsp;attempted at Mersham Parish Church
on August 26th to his memory, and also as a fond farewell compliment to
Rev. Canon Tipping who had been Minister at Mersham for 15 years, and
who
retired at the end of July. &nbsp; This peal unfortunately coming to
grief, a well struck Quarter Peal of Stedman Triples was, instead, rung.<br>

It is sad that we are having to bid farewell to so many of our good
friends, but our Minister of New Romney, and his wife are leaving us to
take up a new group of Parishes in Leicestershire. &nbsp;They have both
been such great supporters of ringing at New Romney and especially this
Guild; Rev. Dale serving as President, and Mrs Dale as our Mistress
this year. &nbsp;We shall be sad to see them go, for they have done so
much for the advancement of ringing on the Marsh and have been both
friends to us and good and faithful servants to the work of the Guild.
&nbsp;Peals are to be attempted to bid them a fond farewell and best
wishes for the future; and many members will doubtless keep in close
contact with them

Rev Canon J.W. Tipping has retired from the Parish of Mersham, and we
wish him and Mrs Tipping long years of happy retirement. &nbsp;We are
so sorry to see him go. &nbsp;A farewell peal was attempted, but this
coming to grief through the ringing not being up to the usual standard,
a well-struck Quarter Peal of Stedman Triples was rung instead.

The success of the RM
&amp; DG over the past six years cannot be overstated.&nbsp; Under the
successive leadership of Miss Gifford of Burmarsh (Aged only 10 at the
time!), Mr Head of Milton Keynes, Mr Hearn of High Wycombe, and now Mrs
Dale of New Romney, the membership has increased to over 70.<br>













      <br>













The
first peal for the Guild since 1939 was scored on New Years Day 2004 -
Annable's 5040 Bob Major at Mersham conducted by the Secretary, and
including one member for whom this was her first peal.&nbsp; The peal
belatedly marked the centenary of the first Guild peal on the bells of
New Romney, which took place on October 25th 1903.<br>

Meetings took
place most months through 2003: Appledore (AGM), Rolvenden, Benenden,
Stone in Oxney (twice), Mersham (twice) Burmarsh, and Hothfield, with a
Summer Meeting comprising ringing at Fairfield, followed by a Songs of
Praise Service led by Canon J.W. Everett using Hymns from "Hymns
A&amp;M Revised", and readings from the Authorised Version of the
Bible, and the Evening rounded off with a social at "The Red Lion,
Snargate".<br>













      <br>













&nbsp;In December 2003 and December 2004 the Leeds Society
of Handbell Ringers (comprising Guild members) played tunes on the
Leeds handbells at "The Red Lion, Snargate".<br>













      <br>













&nbsp;Saturday Meetings
did not take place during 2004, owing to other commitments in the
earlier part, and the Leeds debacle in the latter part of the year.&nbsp;
However, regular monthly Guild practices continued at Mersham and
Burmarsh. <br>













      <br>













The 2005 scheduled AGM was held at the Parish Church
in Ashford, with ringing preceding the Festal Service of Evensong from
the BCP, and led by the Master.&nbsp; It was a pity that attendance was so
poor, though this was due in part to the Ringing World receiving the
AGM notice too late for publication - thus the AGM was not official,
and the vacancy for Master was filled by Mr G. Hayward, the other
Officers remaining in their positions.<br>













&nbsp;<br>













Practices at Mersham
(1st Wednesday) and Burmarsh (2nd Wednesday) have continued through
2005, and Saturday Meetings were also restarted in July -&nbsp; following
the lull of 2004 - with ringing at New Romney and Stone on 23rd July.<br>












      <br>












Since July 2005, the Guild has also become involved with New Romney -
practices are now held there each Thursday.
&nbsp;The Guild Secretary is particularly delighted that New Romney are
now being rung by the Guild. &nbsp;This realises an ambition to teach a local band
to ring for Sunday service, which ambition the Secretary has wished
for, for 10 years - since his schooldays at New Romney, when he did
much work to clean the tower and arranged Quarter Peals of Norwich and
of Oxford Treble Bob Minor on the back six, and of Bristol (his first
QP of S. Major) and Superlative S. Major (rung following school
prizegiving for his year, the Vth form) all in 1995.<br>
