      <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">St James's Society [Est. 1824].</span></h2>







It has been 104 years, but now the old St James's Society [Established
in 1824] is working again with an image to match that of the old times.
&nbsp;Whilst the old LCA had patches of success, it - unfortunately -
was cared for very little in latter years, and was supposedly closed.
&nbsp;It would appear this was to satisfy various ends. &nbsp;The St.
James's Society, in striking contrast to the LCA was a much smaller
organisation which aimed at a certain way of carrying on, rather than
trying to emulate many of the County Associations which had sprung up
at the time of the renaming and enlargement of the old St James's
Society into the LCA. &nbsp;The LCA served its purpose in its time, and
could have had a future, but ultimately this would have involved
shaking off its image, and it would appear that few wished to bother
with that. &nbsp;Practices will be arranged to suit those wishing to
advance themselves in the Art within London, placed above a territorial
Association level, but below the standard for the two senior London
Societies. &nbsp;Whilst it will be useful to assist persons wishing to
advance their ringing, it will also be as well for folk to note that it
is a common misconception that the St James's Society was originally
formed to allow ASCY and SRCY members to ring peals together, and this
is not at all an aim of the current Society, any more than it was the
aim of those who began the original St James' Society. &nbsp;Until the
1850's the St James's Society was simply a Society which &nbsp;was
founded in part by Thomas Tolladay from a society calling itself
&nbsp;"The Westminster Youths" and Established about the year 1800.
&nbsp;Tolladay was very keen to revive ringing in London which had
reached a low ebb. &nbsp;From the 1850's, members of both SRCY and ASCY
rang peals under the name of The St James's Society simply as a flag of
convenience to allow them to ring peals of particularly Stedman Cinques
on handbells and, for instance, the fourth peal of Superlative ever rung and the first in the Metropolis
(on tower bells at St Matthew's Bethnal Green) on 9th February 1850.
&nbsp;It is an important distinction to make here that the &nbsp;St
James's Society was never founded as a way of members of ASCY/SRCY
ringing peals together, and thus there is no suggestion that the
current Society should be seeking to do this; rather more lately a "St
James' Guild" seems to be used to this end.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h2>ST DUNSTAN, STEPNEY BACK IN ACTION.</h2>







The
famous old ring at Stepney are now back in good going order, following
the complete replacement of the tower roof, and building of a new sound
lantern. &nbsp;New lighting has also been fitted on the stairs between
the ringing room and the roof. &nbsp;The bellchamber floor has also
been cleaned, and the Ellacombe hammers which had come loose replaced
temporarily by the Steeplekeeper (although locknuts will be fitted
later this year to avoid the hammers coming loose in future, which
could damage the bells.) &nbsp;All those wishing to book the bells
should contact the Steeplekeeper. &nbsp;The bells are readily
available, and the church authorities pleased to have them rung.<br>

      <h2>A brief History of the Companies of The Eastern Youths, The Trinity Youths of Deptford &nbsp;and The Westminster Youths<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>&nbsp;The name encompasses two
      great old London Ringing Companies.&nbsp; The first is the Eastern Youths
      of London, established probably around 1690.&nbsp; Little is known about
      them other than the fact that they gave two treble's to St Magnus the
      Martyr, Lower Thames Street in 1718.&nbsp; It is likely that the Eastern
      Scholars who formed later in the 18th Century were the result of an
      amalgamation between the Eastern Youths and British Scholars.</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The Trinity Youths of Deptford were established in 1782.&nbsp; They
      were based at St Nicholas Deptford (A Hadley and Newton 8 from 1701,
      outrageously scrapped at the end of the Second World War).&nbsp; They
      faded out in the early part of the 19th Century, and were re-established
      in the 1870's, only to suffer a similar decline 20 or so years
      later.&nbsp; In their second establishment they rang at Greenwich,
      Deptford (St Johns) and some other Towers in the vicinity.</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The Westminster Youths were formed in the late 18th Century.&nbsp; They
      were only a minor Company of ringers and faded out quite quickly, though
      the Society was re-established at St James Clerkenwell in 1824 as the St
      James' Society, which later became The London County Association.</p>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The St James's Society continues today
      with its maintenance work, particularly focussing on
      preservation of interesting and rare installations, and historical
      towers.&nbsp; It provides ringers for special occasions by Church Request
      at St Paul Shadwell, St Dunstan Stepney, St Matthew Bethnal Green and St
      John Deptford.</p>
